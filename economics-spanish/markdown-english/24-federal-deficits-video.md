FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: "Our war program for the coming fiscal year will cost 56
billion dollars…"
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: 1945… By the war's end, the price tag will pass 200 billion
dollars. How will we pay for World War II?
1960. As President Eisenhower talks of paying off the national debt, the economy
stumbles into a recession. How can a budget surplus hurt the economy?
In 2011. Crisis was at hand.
BARACK OBAMA: “There’s no doubt that we’re going to have to also address the long
term quandary of a government that routinely and extravagantly spends more than it takes
in.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Just how would the Government respond? For almost
every year in the last 50 years the Federal Government has spent more money than it
takes in. Year after year the tide of red ink rolls in. Federal deficits: Can we still live
with them? We’ll investigate that question with the help of economic analysts Nariman
Behravesh and Richard Gill on this 21st Century edition of Economics U$A. I’m David
Schoumacher.

(FEDERAL DEFICITS: Can We Live With Them? Appears on the screen)
# Part I

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Most of us have been taught that to spend more money than
we earn is to court financial disaster, but the federal government seems to play by a
different set of rules. Almost every year the country runs a deficit. Yet we're told that
deficit is necessary. Even beneficial. But deficits piled one on top of another create a
growing national debt. And the interest payments on that debt add more dollars to the
next year's deficit. During a five-year span back in the 1940's, our national debt more
than quadrupled as we fought World War II. How did we pay for that war? And why
didn't it bankrupt us?
Early in the morning of September 1, 1939, German armies marched into Poland and the
world exploded into war. By 1940, the Germans controlled Europe and were poised to
attack Britain. A frightened American Congress appropriated 37 billion dollars for
defense, more than the entire cost of World War I. How would the government raise
these huge sums?
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: "That means taxes and bonds, and bonds and taxes…"
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Treasury official, Roy Blough, remembers.

<!-- Page 4 -->

ROY BLOUGH: “Now The Treasury view, and I shared it, was you get as much out of
taxes as you can, and up to 100 percent. Now of course we never succeeded in doing
that. You take the whole war period. The tax revenues for the war period were a little
less than half of the total. The rest of it was borrowed.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In England, economist John Maynard Keynes urged the
American government to borrow from a pool of money created by a compulsory savings
program. But a group of young American economists had a better idea, as Richard
Gilbert recalls.
RICHARD GILBERT: “The group which I led proposed to finance the war through
borrowing, in itself not different from the Keynesian proposal, but with a direct control of
prices and wages to prevent the kind of inflation that had always been associated with
war in the past; and to bring to full employment, as rapidly as possible, the enormous
energies of the American public, once harnessed to the effort.”
STEWARDESS: “As an airplane worker, I ask all of you to help to support our armed
forces by buying more war bonds and stamps. As our boys would say: ‘You buy 'em…
we'll fly 'em.’ “
INTERVIEWEE: “This is a working man's country and I'm doing my part to keep it that
way. Buy more bonds today."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Fresh from a decade of hunger and deprivation, the
American people cheerfully loaned dollars by the billions to their government. As the
war intensified, the economy boomed. Fifteen million Americans went to war. 66
million more went to work. For the first time in ten years Americans had money to
spend, but little to spend it on. Not only were luxuries unavailable, but such basics as
housing were hard to come by.

RICHARD GILBERT: “All construction was limited except by license. The production
of cars and other durables was totally eliminated for the war period. In other words, there
could be no private investment other than that required for the war effort. And the result
was that if the government had not borrowed these sums that were being saved in the
community and not invested, the result would have been not full employment, but
another depression.”
### DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Government tax revenues increased dramatically

throughout the war, but government expenditures increased even more. By the war's end,
the federal government had borrowed almost 200 billion dollars, 1/4 of it from private
individuals, most of the rest from the banking system. The deficits were huge. The
national debt quadrupled in only four years.
Dr. Blough, what would have happened if we had tried to pay, as we went, for World
### War II?

ROY BLOUGH: “I think it would have probably been rather harmful to the economy. I
sometimes extravagantly said we would have lost the war. If we had tried to do it by
pay-as-you-go, we would have had to impose very much more of a dictatorship on the
community than we did have to.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The end of the war found the country facing a huge national
debt. Yet, somehow, the 260 billion dollars we owed in 1945 did not seem as terrifying
as the 40 billion we'd owed in 1939. The nation was prosperous. As the economy grew,
tax revenues increased and government expenses declined. And years later, as all those
billions of dollars of World War II bonds came due, the government simply borrowed
new money to pay the old obligation. The nation had gone deeply into debt to pay for the
war. The debt never really went away. It just seemed to shrink in size compared to the
total GNP. We asked economic analyst Richard Gill if this meant that we had passed on
the cost of the war to future generations?

RICHARD GILL: The simple answer is no: the basic costs of World War II were borne
by the generation that lived and worked during World War II. Look at it in terms of the
old standbys, guns and butter. We start before the war with an economy that is producing
only butter. That is, civilian goods. Now when the war comes, we have to divert some of
our resources to gun production. The economic cost of the war is borne right then and
there and is basically the amount of butter we have to give up because we are producing
armaments.
The cost of the war in terms of lost butter production was minimal because we entered
the war from the Great Depression, with enormous unused capacity and unemployment in
the economy. To a great degree, we were able to add gun production onto our previous
butter production by simply employing these unused resources. In one basic way, the
war did impose direct costs on the next generation.
Our civilian production is composed not only of consumption goods, like butter, but also
investment goods: factories, machines and the like, to increase future production.
Insofar as the war replaced investment (I) with guns (G), we left a smaller productive
capacity to the next generation. But what about the interest payments on the debt? Aren't
these a cost to future generations? They are, and we'll indicate how later on. For the
moment, we should bear in mind that because of the enormous growth of the American
economy in the decades following the war, federal interest payments as a percentage of
our GNP remained low, around one and one half percent. And this percentage was
actually falling from 1946 to the mid 1960s.
It was for this reason that most of the economists of the time took the line: "The national
debt? No problem! Our growing economy will take care of it!"

# Part Ii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: 1960 would be President Eisenhower's last year in office.
He had just run the biggest peacetime deficit in U.S. history, a result of the recession of
1958. He promised the American people a budget surplus in 1960, and on that rock the
presidential aspirations of Richard Nixon would soon founder. What could possibly be
wrong with a budget surplus?
The prosperity that began with the end of World War II continued through the
Eisenhower years with only minor interruptions. But 1958 seemed to be a sharp step
backwards, the deepest recession since the 1930s. The government pumped money into
the economy to stimulate a quick recovery, spending on such projects as the Interstate
Highways Program. This spending during a recession was called a counter-cyclical
policy, and it worked. By 1959 the economy was improving.
President Eisenhower wanted to leave office with a balanced budget, so he began to push
hard for a surplus in 1960. But Vice-President Nixon was running for president that year.
He wanted a growing economy, so he argued for a deficit. Many economists agreed with
Nixon, but Ike stuck to his guns. His Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors,
Raymond Saulnier, remembers the pressure.
RAYMOND SAULNIER: “You don't have any problem with how much money is going
to be spent. You are surrounded by people prepared, at the drop of a hat, to spend untold
amounts of money. That's never a problem. What the problem is, to raise the funds to
meet that. So, if we were pushing hard in 1960, and my recollection is that we were, we
were pushing hard to reach this equivalence of income and outgo."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Many of his advisors thought Eisenhower did not have time
to oversee a complete recovery from the recession of 1958, that his drive for a budget
surplus was premature. They urged him to continue spending to fuel the recovery. 1960

was Ike's last year in office. Perhaps he thought inflation was a more serious threat than
unemployment. But, as the economy stalled, the President did not seem worried.
HERBERT STEIN: “1960, he was leaving office, he was not running again. The pains
of the recession that we were having in 1960 were not so evident to him as the pains of
the 1954 recession had been. They were pretty evident to Mr. Nixon, who was running,
and he was very unhappy about the situation."
RAYMOND SAULNIER: “We didn't expect that the next president was going to be
John Kennedy. The next president was going to be Richard Nixon. I think that was
pretty generally the expectation in the Republican family. It certainly was my
expectation. So Eisenhower went out in that message with a strategy that left tax
reduction for the next president."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Nixon urged Eisenhower to stimulate the economy with an
immediate tax cut. Ike declined. By mid-summer the economy had ground to a halt well
short of full-employment. The budget surplus was holding money out of the economy
and costing workers their jobs. While John Kennedy campaigned on a promise to get the
country moving again, Richard Nixon was forced to publicly support a policy he
privately opposed. The country hit bottom just two weeks before the election. For
Nixon, the damage had been done.
NIXON: “If the present trend continues, Mr. Kennedy, Senator Kennedy, will be the
next President of the United States."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Kennedy won with a margin so narrow that people still
argue over what tipped the balance. But Nixon had no doubt. He blamed the Recession
of 1960 for costing him the election. Historians still argue over the significance of the
Recession of 1960, but economists at the time were convinced that the budget surplus
cost the economy jobs and growth by keeping dollars in the hands of the government
rather than consumers. Had Eisenhower been willing to end his presidency with a deficit,

he might have presented his successor with more growth and the prospect of even larger
surpluses in the future. We asked economic analyst Richard Gill to explain why
economists might be opposed to budget surpluses.
# (Music Plays—Comment & Analysis Ii)

### Economics U$A Logo

RICHARD GILL: I've already pointed out that the federal interest payments and the
national debt itself were falling all through the 1950s as a percentage of our national
income. Thus there seemed no urgent reason to try for a budget surplus at this time.
More significantly, the predominant Keynesian view of the time said that the government
ought to pursue a counter-cyclical policy. This would involve budget deficits in bad
times to expand the economy, and budget surpluses in good times to keep things in
check.
Suppose the economy is experiencing a business cycle, and GNP is going up and then
down. What the government ought to do, most economists in 1960 were saying, is follow
this course: Budget deficits during the recessions; budget surpluses during the booms.
The idea was that this would lead to a much smoother path, so smooth in fact that many
economists began asking the question: "Is the business cycle a thing of the past?"… a
question, sadly, which proved to be a bit premature, as, indeed, did our complacency
about the national debt.
# Part Iii

BILL CLINTON: “We are on course for budget surpluses for the next twenty-five
years.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Well, not exactly! President Clinton’s 1998 projection
could not have been more optimistic. In 2010 the Federal Deficit was 1.3 trillion dollars,
and the national debt stood at 14 trillion dollars. That was more than 96 percent of GDP.

<!-- Page 10 -->

Everyone on Capitol Hill agreed that the deficit had to be cut and the budget balanced.
But would lawmakers be able to find a bipartisan solution?
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: America has fought four wars --Vietnam, Iraq I and II and
Afghanistan – almost entirely without raising taxes to pay for them. In addition, while
entitlement programs devour an ever-increasing chunk of the budget, politicians continue
to use tax cuts as a great way to get re-elected. So, how have these increases in spending
and decreases in taxes been funded? Through borrowing. But borrowing has a cost to it.
Interest! In 2011, almost half a trillion dollars. How to fix the deficit and how to balance
the budget are complicated questions.
BARACK OBAMA: “There’s no doubt we are going to also have to address the long
term quandary of a government that routinely and extravagantly spends more than it takes
in.”
### DAVID SCHOUMACHER: America’s runaway deficit prompted President Barack

Obama to establish a bi-partisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and
Reform. There were 18 members, including the Co-Chairs, former Republican Senator
Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles, Chief of staff in the Clinton
Administration. But, in 2010, politicians from both sides of the aisle agreed, it was time
for answers, time for solutions, as “The Moment of Truth” had arrived.
ALAN SIMPSON: “It is 67 pages, it’s written in English. It wasn’t written for pedants
or panderers or politicians or journalists. It was written for the American people. It uses
terms like going broke, shared sacrifice and where we are. If you spend more than you
earn you lose your butt, and secondly if for every buck you spend you borrow 40 cents to
do it, you’ve got to be stupid and that’s your country right now.”

<!-- Page 11 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Economist Alice Rivlin also sat on the Commission.
ALICE RIVLIN: “Well, when any group of people sits down and looks at the federal
budget going forward over the next ten years, they see, first we can’t go on like this. We
are borrowing more and more every year.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Rivlin says we are borrowing more because spending is
rising rapidly for the health care entitlement programs--Medicare and Medicaid. To
compound the problem, these health care costs will soar even higher as the baby boom
generation retires.
ALICE RIVLIN: “When you take more older people, higher health care, and you
multiply the two, it means that without changing the law, or changing anything, federal
spending is going to grow faster than the economy can possibly grow, and the revenues
won’t, so that is the problem.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: So we are back to the question, how do we fix the problem?
After a year of hard work and compromise, the Simpson-Bowles Commission came up
with a daring proposal to cut the deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade.
Daring…because nothing was off limits. It called for $200 billion from all agencies,
including the Pentagon, $100 billion squeezed out of the tax code, and, most
important…It called for reform of the entitlement programs -- both health care spending
and Social Security, to ensure long term solvency.
ALAN SIMPSON: “The fun and games is over. The BS is over. The crap... When you
hear a politician of either stripe or either sex on their hind legs, they say, ‘We can get this
done. Thank god it came up. We’re gonna get rid of waste fraud and abuse, all foreign
aid, all ear marks, Nancy Pelosi’s airplane, Air Force One, all Congressional Pensions,
and all the rest.’ Great, that will get us about six percent out of the hole we’re in. So
then you say to that person, ‘Thank you so much for that drivel you just gave us, now
what the hell are you going to do with Medicare, Medicaid, and the solvency of Social

Security?’ Not balancing the budget on the backs of poor old seniors and calling this the
cat food commission. To make it solvent and then do something with the defense budget,
which is two-thirds of the discretionary budget in the United States.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The Report was supported by eleven of the eighteen
members of the Commission, including both Simpson and Bowles, but it did not get the
fourteen votes required for passage by the full Commission.
DOUGLAS HOLTZ EAKIN: “I thought it was a remarkable moment. Everyone had
very low expectations for the commission. I had perhaps the lowest; I’ll be honest about
that, because commissions don’t have a great track record in the United States. Instead.
they came out and produced a bipartisan report, substantial support on both sides of the
aisle. They said four important things. This problem is big. I certainly agree with that.
This problem is spending. You can’t say this is just the military. You can’t just say it’s
welfare programs. It is everything the federal government is doing. And number four, if
you want more revenue, this system is so broken you need tax reform to get it.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But did the Simpson-Bowles recommendations fall on deaf
ears at the highest level? When President Obama announced his fiscal 2012 budget, it
reduced the deficit by only $1 trillion dollars, not four trillion.
BARACK OBAMA: “What we’ve done is taken a scalpel to the discretionary budget
rather than a machete. That side of the ledger only accounts for about 12 percent of our
budget. So we’ve got a whole bunch of other stuff that we’re going to have to do,
including entitlements... Medicare and Medicaid are huge problems... I’m prepared to
work with Democrats and Republicans to start dealing with that in a serious way.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Obama’s budget ignored many of the panel’s proposals
regarding the entitlement programs, including raising the retirement age for Social
Security and charging wealthy seniors more for Medicare. Was Simpson disappointed in
Obama’s budget? Did it fly in the face of all his commission proposed? Simpson insists

<!-- Page 13 -->

the president’s budget was driven by politics, not policy. He was not surprised the
president avoided entitlements.
ALAN SIMPSON: “That is what he had to do. It is too fragile right now. That is why
the Republicans, a week later, did the same thing. Played dodge ‘em. Reason is because
Obama knew that if he came out with the big stuff in this recommendation he would be
torn to bits. And then the fun would start.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: And politics is what makes reducing the deficit so tricky
because no one wants to see cuts in the programs that benefit their own lives. Whether
it’s for AARP or veterans, special interest groups continue to lobby Congress hard to
keep their funding intact. Everyone has to sacrifice, but no one wants to.
Given the deep pockets of special interests, and the polarization in Congress, can a
compromise on the budget be reached? Economists say yes, because the alternative is
not an option. The deficit is staggering and the mission to find a solution is urgent.
ALICE RIVLIN: “This is the moment because we are in dire straights. This is very
serious stuff. We might torpedo our economy if we don’t get this solved.”
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: “The bad news scenario is one where people actually say,
oh my God, they are absolutely not changing their trajectory. We know it doesn’t add up
and you get sharp withdrawal of credit from the United States. The kinds of things we
saw in Greece, and Ireland, and what we lived through in 2008. We have it in our
capacity to change course...and I think we should. “
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Faced with a last minute government shutdown, the
President and Congressional leaders reached a compromise: 38 Billion Dollars to be cut
from the 2011 budget. A figure Simpson & Bowles declared “won’t amount to a hill of
beans when it comes to controlling the spiraling debt.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: When Senator Alan Simpson announced the committee’s
recommendations in the document “The Moment of Truth,” he jokingly said that he and
Erskine Bowles will “be on the witness-protection list when this is over.” But in this case
shooting the messenger just wouldn’t help. What would be the ramifications if we fail to
act? We asked that of Economic Analyst Nariman Behravesh.
## Music Plays (Comment And Analysis Iii):

NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: Few countries have survived the steady rise of their
government debt levels unscathed. Circumstances may differ, but most countries that
have seen the ratio of their government debt to GDP rise over 100% have suffered some
kind of crisis of confidence. This usually means that investors flee the country, pushing
up interest rates and pushing down the value of the currency. It is hard to say when
something like this could happen to the United States, which, after all, does have
something of a unique role in the global economy. Nevertheless, even the U.S. can’t
write IOUs indefinitely.
At some point investors will begin to worry that the American government may have
some trouble repaying its debt. These investors will then do one of two things: either sell
U.S. government bonds and/or demand higher interest rates to hold those bonds. The
resulting higher interest rates could do a lot of economic damage. So, in the end, inaction
is not an option when it comes to the large and growing U.S. national debt.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Every year we use a good part of our annual budget just to
pay the interest on the debt. And still we continue accumulating debt. In 2011 the
Treasury Department asked Congress to increase the nation’s debt ceiling (that’s a cap set
by Congress on the amount of debt the federal government can legally borrow...).
Increase it, to over 14.3 trillion dollars. And that set off another brouhaha. So, do
deficits always hurt us? Not always. But can we continue to live with them? Today the
answer is a resounding NO! For this 21st Century edition of Economics U$A, I’m David
Schoumacher.
