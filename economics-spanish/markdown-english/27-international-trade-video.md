DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Japanese cars brought low prices and high gas mileage to
American drivers. What happened when political pressure forced import cutbacks? The
American steel industry thought their foreign competitors were violating trade laws to
make sales in the United States. How did the U.S. government try to make foreign
governments and steel companies play fair? American companies manufacturing abroad
and the North American Free Trade Agreement--Would Americans hear a giant sucking
sound of millions of jobs going to Mexico?
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: I’m standing in front of the Ronald Reagan Building and
International Trade Center in Washington D.C. to ask this question: “International Trade
– for whose benefit?” With the help of Economic Analysts Richard Gill and Nariman
Behravesh we’ll explore that question on this 21st-Century edition of Economics U$A.
I’m David Schoumacher.

# Part I

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Nobody worried too much about the first Japanese cars to
reach the United States. It was the “heyday” of the “gas guzzler.” As the nation’s largest
consumer of steel, glass and rubber, the auto industry drove the economy. Since the days
of Henry Ford the American auto industry kept its hand on the wheel and its foot on the
accelerator. Detroit sold the big car; and American drivers bought it. High gas mileage
didn’t mean much to people used to 30-cent gas. 1973 changed that. War in the Middle
East and an oil embargo were followed by short supplies, gas lines, and skyrocketing
prices. Higher gas prices made Datsuns and Toyotas look a lot better. To some,
importing Japanese cars meant exporting American jobs. So why not just cut imports to
save jobs? For drivers, cars are transportation, but in Detroit, cars are jobs... good jobs
and lots of them. For autoworkers, more imports would mean layoffs, often permanent
layoffs, and a search for new work by men and women who had spent their lives on the
assembly line. President Douglas Fraser of the powerful Autoworkers Union took the
workers’ case to Washington. His members and their employers needed protection from
their Japanese competitors. Protecting autoworkers and the auto industry made little
sense to believers in free trade like economist Robert Crandell of the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.
ROBERT CRANDELL: “I rather think that the protection for workers in that industry
defeats the purpose. To the extent that we protect those workers and protect that
industry…and keep an umbrella over their prices, their profits and their wage rates,
there’s no incentive for them to reform.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But on Capitol Hill, worried workers swung more weight
than eminent economists, especially with Detroit Congressman John Dingell, Chairman
of the House committee which sets import rules.
JOHN DINGELL: “Almost every country has quotas on importation of Japanese
automobiles. The French say that they can bring in any number, but only two or three
percent will leave the dock. The Italians allow in 2,300. The British allow in
approximately 10 percent, the Germans approximately 10 percent. The Japanese,
however, will set up automobile industries around the world in the full expectation that
those automobile industries as well as their own are going to be exporting into the United
States. So I felt it was absolutely necessary, in view of the grotesquely unfair trade
practices of our trading partners…especially the Japanese...that real quotas, and domestic
content requirements equal to those of other nations…should be laid in place by the
### United States.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: John Dingell was one of the leaders of a building drumbeat
of protectionist feeling in Congress and in the press. Free traders fought back. In the
middle was the nation’s chief trade official… Special Trade Representative, William
Brock.
WILLIAM BROCK: “You know, they came to us…and Congress…and they said, ‘You
gotta protect us.’ Congress started talking about passing a bill to hold imports to maybe
half the present level at that time. We didn’t like that because we thought by using the
wrong action once, you protect something like that, you can’t get rid of the protection.
So we talked to the Japanese and we said, ‘Look, it takes 5, 6, 7 years to re-tool to a
completely new market demand. You can’t just dream up a new car and put it out for
sale. You have to design and engineer it, build new plants for it, build new machines to
produce it, and that’s a long-term process.’ And we suggested that it would be
appreciated if they restrained for a limited period of time…3 or 4 years. They did.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Voluntarily or not, the restrictions took hold. Japanese auto
imports dropped by almost eight percent in a year. Thousands of autoworkers were off
unemployment and back on the job. Happy ending? Sure, if your livelihood depends on
the auto industry, but if you’re buying instead of making or selling cars, it might be a
different story. In the wake of the voluntary restraints a new sticker appeared on
Japanese cars… the ADM--Additional Dealer Markup.
TOYOTA SALESMAN: “Generally you are going to pay a little bit more for a Japanese
car versus an American car, but I think the level of quality that you find in a small car is
worth it.”
CAR BUYER: “Oh it bothers me immensely. I wish they’d get rid of the import quotas.
I think it’s one of the biggest rip-offs of Americans I ever heard of. It’s only to protect
incompetent automobile manufacturers.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Bad news for buyers was good news for dealers like Toyota
dealer, Kay Jennings.
KAY JENNINGS: “For the Japanese car business we sold fewer cars, but we had many
many price increases because of the restrictions. Because if you have fewer cars the
prices are going to go up but it did the same thing to the American cars. The only thing
where the restrictions really hurt was the general public.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: And it wasn’t only the buyers of Japanese cars who were
hurting. We paid more for American cars as well, as American car dealers discovered
that they could raise prices, too, as long as they stayed under Japanese prices. In Detroit,
employment was high, but at what cost to car buyers?
ROBERT CRANDELL: “How much did it cost American consumers in terms of higher
prices of automobiles in order to keep one additional job in and around Detroit? And the
answer was, by my calculation, somewhere around 160 thousand dollars. That may

sound high to you, but almost every calculation of the effective trade restraints on
employment levels of the United States comes out with something around 100 or 200,000
dollars per job. It’s not unusual.”
JOHN DINGELL: “This kind of a fellow looks at the problem that a consumer has in
terms of paying a little more for the goods at this particular time. He doesn’t look at the
future increases that are going to be loaded on once our American automobile industry
and other industries are down the tube. Nor does he look at the economic consequences
of being dependent on goods abroad. He doesn’t look at the other costs that are
associated with this and, in consequence, he is breeding himself a splendid future and
present disaster because he’s not looking at the world as it really exists.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The competition that comes with trade means choices for
society as well as consumers. The cost of saving thousands of American jobs may be
fewer choices and higher prices for millions of American consumers. We asked
economic analyst Richard Gill if the American jobs that were saved were worth the
higher prices of cars that followed the restrictions.

RICHARD GILL: It’s a difficult question to answer because it has so many
ramifications. Over the long run, exports and imports for a given country tend to balance
out, as indeed they must for all nations considered together. Since imports, in a certain
sense, “cost” us jobs, and since exports, in a certain sense, “create” jobs, there is, in
principle, no long-run unemployment problem associated with free trade. Hence,
economists say, let trade be free so that consumers can have lower car prices; that is, they
can enjoy the gains from comparative advantage we discussed earlier. However, in the
short-run, increases of particular imports, cars, textiles, whatever, can definitely cost jobs
in those industries. Thus, against the gain of having cheaper goods for consumers, you
can have painful dislocations in specific domestic industries. Also, the long run over

which exports and imports are likely to balance may be a very long run. We have been
running major deficits with Japan for years. Good news in terms of getting cheaper
goods. Bad news in terms of a downward pressure on employment. Still, in total, the
gains from comparative advantage tend to be so large that economists, unlike perhaps
autoworkers or textile producers, are willing to wait for the long-term adjustments to
work out. Of course, if the other country is competing unfairly, then that is another
matter!
# Part Ii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: America likes competition on the football field, in politics,
before the law and in business. An even match on a level field seems to be the best way
to decide the best team, the best candidate, or the best buy. But what happens when a
foreign company, a company beyond the reach of American law, doesn’t play fair? What
happens when “free trade” isn’t “fair trade?” The American steel industry, Modern
America, its buildings, its bridges, its cars, was built on steel. For almost 75 years, the
industrial giants which ran American steel played by their own rules. Lack of
competition made price increases easy, easier than replacing old and inefficient factories
and easier than risking costly strikes over pay raises. But in the 70’s, the American steel
industry found itself under competitive fire for the first time. And its historic
complacency started coming home to roost. As U.S. Steel waned, Euro Steel waxed.
Steel producers from countries like Germany and Britain undercut American companies
on American buildings and bridges. Some suspected that German and British steel
makers were dumping, selling steel in the United States for less than they were selling it
at home, perhaps even less that it cost them to make it.
JOHN DINGELL: “There’s no way that this country, which has the only private steel
industry in the world, can compete with government steel dumped over here. So, through
a whole broad spectrum of devices and the clearest violations of GATT and other
agreements, and also our laws, subsidy goes on. They bring it over at a subsidized price.”

<!-- Page 8 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But if foreign governments were willing to take losses
selling below cost in the United States, why shouldn’t we just sit back and enjoy the low
prices?
WILLIAM BROCK: “Another government could pick an industry, subsidize the dickens
out of it, and give it enough money to buy into the U.S. market, and if they gave them
enough, they could destroy the U.S. industry because our industry is just one or two or
three companies competing with the whole government in some other country, with their
whole treasury.”
JOHN DINGELL: “Well, the practical result of that is to simply dispose of your
industry. And ultimately and probably not very far down the line, you will have disposed
of your steel, your auto industry. You will have grotesquely hurt all of the industries of
which the auto industry is the largest single consumer. That includes computers, textiles,
steel, non-ferrous metals, glass, rubber, and a lot of other things. And you will find that
you simply will have de-industrialized that part of your economy. You will find that you
have lost a prodigious number of jobs and you will convert from high paying jobs to low
paying jobs. Not on the basis of fair competition, but on the basis of subsidy. And all of
a sudden, all of those consumers that you had been trying to benefit by seeing to it that
they got low prices on subsidized exports that come into the United States—they’re not
consumers anymore because they can’t afford to buy anything.”
ROBERT CRANDELL: “Congressman Dingell doesn’t have enough faith. One of our
greatest resources is our human capital stock. We have an enormously talented educated
work force. The notion that somehow the only thing that we’ll be able to find for them to
do is to flip hamburgers at McDonald’s I think is outrageous. I don’t think that a society
is likely to succeed for most of its citizens by trying to lean against the forces of
technological and economic change. And it seems to me that that’s what this debate’s
about.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: With industry and jobs on the line, pressure mounted on

President Jimmy Carter. Americans deserve protection from predatory pricing practices
from abroad, but Congressman Dingell might lead Congress to pass outright quotas,
which could wreck the complex and delicate framework of world trade. As the crisis
reached its peak, Carter turned to one of the country’s experts on international trade and
finance, Deputy Treasury Secretary Anthony Solomon. Solomon’s solution – the “trigger
price mechanism.” Use the Japanese production price as the trigger for starting dumping
investigations.
ANTHONY SOLOMON: “Everybody in the world accepted the fact that Japanese costs
of production were the lowest in the world. And, therefore, if you sold below that, then
there were good grounds for suspicion that you were dumping. You were not covering
your cost of production, which was the definition under the law. The idea was to meet
their legitimate complaint about dumping in a way that would be less disruptive of
imports that would be of some help to the steel industry, and at the same time maintain
price competition, particularly in the zones above that of covering the cost of production
of the most efficient producer in the world. I must tell you that a lot of economists have
told me that it was a very elegant concept.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Elegant it may have been, but did it work?
WILLIAM BROCK: “Trigger price mechanism was an effort to sort of soft-land the
U.S. steel industry, to not totally protect, but to give them some assurance that they
weren’t going to be undercut in prices and could continue to grow and to invest.”
ANTHONY SOLOMON: “I’m rather pleased by, frankly, my ingenuity in coming up
with it. It still preserved the basic comparative cost of advantage theory which underlies
international trade. It solved, for a couple of years, the political problem, and avoided
protectionist quota action. And all the key actors, both the domestic industry and labor
on the one hand, the foreign exporters to our market on the other, all felt that it was a
much better solution than what was happening without it.”

<!-- Page 10 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The international steel trade speeded up in the wake of the
“Trigger-price mechanism.” While the TPM slowed down subsidized competition from
Germany and Britain, Japan’s high efficiency steel industry, and low labor cost steel
producers from Korea, Argentina and Brazil, got into the game. The “trigger-price
mechanism” was an effort to draw a line in a battle between fair and unfair trade
practices. The war is much wider. It’s not confined to the steel industry or to dumping or
to any one or two countries. After the “trigger-price mechanism” expired, there was a
strong drift toward protectionism in many countries, including the United States. We
asked Richard Gill to comment.

### Economics U$A Logo

RICHARD GILL: There is little question that in the mid 1980s protectionist sentiment
was in the air. A suspicion arose in the United States that some foreign countries were
using exports to the United States as a means of promoting the domestic growth of their
own economies. They were flooding us with their goods while keeping ours out. If this
suspicion were based on the existence of very high tariffs abroad, it would be fairly easy
to evaluate. Unfortunately, most of the obstacles that countries place in the way of
foreign imports are more subtle than that, what economists call non-tariff barriers to
trade. Government subsidies, as in the case of steel, are sometimes overt, sometimes
hidden and complex: complicated licensing and import procedures; special regulations
concerning the standards, specifications, and testing that imported products have to meet.
The magnitude of such barriers is very difficult to assess. What can be said with some
confidence is that countries who are running huge trade surpluses with the United States,
like Japan, should take quite seriously the effort to open their economies to American
goods as much as they can. For the alternative is very likely to be increased
protectionism in the Untied States, higher tariffs, more quotas, special restrictions of our
own. And, in this case, although we may suffer, our trading partners will suffer too,
perhaps even more seriously. The correct path is as obvious as it seems difficult to
follow.

# Part Iii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: As Congress was considering passage of the North
American Free Trade agreement in 1993, workers in the United States grew increasingly
apprehensive about losing their jobs. A fierce debate raged in the U.S. What would be
the impact of freer trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada?
ROSS PEROT: “Pay a dollar an hour for your labor. Have no health care…that’s the
most expensive single element in making a car…have no environmental controls, no
pollution controls, and no retirement, and you don’t care about anything but making
money. There will be a giant sucking sound going south.”
BILL CLINTON: “Good jobs, rewarding careers, broadened horizons for the middle-
class Americans can only be secured by expanding exports and global growth.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: NAFTA provided that, over a ten to fifteen year period,
virtually all of the tariff barriers and most of the non-tariff barriers would evaporate.
.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Since NAFTA was signed into law in 1993, has it fulfilled
its promise of jobs and prosperity?
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Kansas City Southern Railroad was started in the late 1800s
by Arthur Stillwell. Stillwell’s vision was to build a line from the heartland to the Gulf
Coast and eventually to Mexico.
MICHAEL HAVERTY: “ With our north south orientation we believed that if we could
make an investment in Mexico and tie it into our line that we could develop what we
called the NAFTA railroad.
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 12 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Kansas City Southern started operations to Mexico in June
of 1997, transporting auto parts, grain, consumer products and automobiles.
MICHAEL HAVERTY: “We have not hired more people, but you have to remember
that had we not made that investment in Mexico, we would have probably had to lay off
hundreds of people.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER : The NAFTA Railroad is an example of the kind of
investment and infrastructure so sorely needed in Mexico. While the NAFTA Railroad
didn’t create jobs for its own operation, the fact that it could provide efficient and
economical two way transportation of goods, indirectly generated jobs in other sectors on
both sides of the border.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Bimbo Bakeries was founded 57 years ago in a small
Mexico City storefront. It is now the largest bakery in Mexico.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: At about the time NAFTA was implemented, Bimbo
decided conditions were ripe to have a stronger presence in the U.S., investing heavily in
new facilities and acquiring such products as Entenmann’s Pastries, Thomas’ English
Muffins, and Boboli pizza kits.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Bimbo’s relationship to the U.S. market is mutually
beneficial as it imports much of its main ingredient supplies and equipment from the
United States.
DANIEL SERVITJE: In our case I think that jobs have been created on both sides of the
border because of NAFTA. We now have close to almost 10,000 people working in the
# U.S..

<!-- Page 13 -->

DANIEL SERVITJE: In Mexico we now have a much more stable economy because of
NAFTA. So, certainly, our standard of living and the employment opportunities of our
associates are much broader now then they were before.
LUIS DE LA CALLE: I think Bimbo is leading the way for other Mexican companies to
invest in the U.S. and I think that is one of the counter intuitive results of the NAFTA.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Because of NAFTA, Mexico is a large recipient of direct
U.S. investment, but also because of NAFTA, Mexico is becoming a large investor in the
United States, averaging eight hundred million dollars per year. In addition, Mexico now
buys 14% of goods the U.S. exports to the world. 35 percent of U.S. trade is with Canada
and Mexico, a remarkable and deep integration. But labor representatives have concerns
about the implications of free trade for workers.
THEA LEE: “It’s the question of what is the set of rules that NAFTA put in place and
how has that impacted average working people. One is certainly here in the United
States. We’ve lost over half a million jobs, according to the Labor Department, just since
NAFTA went into effect -- jobs which have moved to Mexico or Canada.”
LUIS DE LA CALLE: “Now, you had some sectors that had experienced job losses both
in Mexico and in the U.S., but these job losses, in my view, are more related to the
globalization than the NAFTA. Let me give you a couple of examples. You have, for
instance, in the U.S., been losing jobs in steel or textiles or apparel. Some of those jobs
have actually come to Mexico, and Mexico would manufacture to find the goods that we
re-export to the U.S. under the NAFTA. Those jobs, the U.S. was going to lose anyway.
The question was whether those jobs would divert to China or Taiwan or they would
come to Mexico. The beauty of the NAFTA was that if they came to Mexico then they
will come with U.S. components.”

<!-- Page 14 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Proponents of NAFTA say that since opening U.S. markets,
particularly after World War II, the country has experienced its greatest growth, its
greatest improvement in jobs, and enjoyed a higher standard of living.
JIM JONES: “I think NAFTA’s been a great success no matter how you measure it. It’s
been a success in improving the standards of living and creating political stability and
openness in Mexico. It’s been a success at creating a net new increase in jobs in the
United States. It’s been a great success in improving understanding between our two
countries.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: So, was there a giant sucking sound of jobs going to
Mexico as Ross Perot had predicted? No. Did it create some new jobs on both sides of
the border? Yes…the effects were positive though not huge. How positive? We asked
Economic Analyst NARIMAN BEHRAVESH.
## (Music Plays - Comment And Analysis Iii)

(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: When a multi-national company from a developed country
such as the U.S. chooses to produce goods in a developing country such as Mexico, the
impact is very similar to international trade.
Production moves to the country with a comparative advantage in producing those goods.
As in the case of trade this benefits both the country making the investment and the
country receiving the investment. While there are some job losses, typically low-skilled
workers in the country making the investment, there are more winners than losers in both
countries.
Thus, investment, like trade has a positive-sum game rather than a zero-sum game. In
other words both countries benefit.

In the end, the early Maquiladora program turned out to be so successful that it was a
major factor behind the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or
NAFTA. The combination of the Maquiladora program and NAFTA has helped Mexico
to enjoy rapid growth during the last two decades. But not at the expense of the U.S.,
where consumers benefited from lower prices and companies trading with Mexico
created new high-skilled jobs.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Economic principle tells us that “free trade,” or at least
“freer trade,” will mean lower consumer prices and better living standards overall. But
in the real world, the short-term world, all of us and our elected officials find it hard to
turn away from the plight of those whose jobs are threatened by competition from abroad
– no matter how fair that competition. For this 21st Century Edition of Economics U$A,
this is David Shoumacher.
