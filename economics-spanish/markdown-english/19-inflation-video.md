DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The 1960s, a time of great prosperity and growth. In a
period characterized by success in managing the economy, how did we let inflation get
out of control? We think of an inflationary period as a time when everybody suffers from
a loss of purchasing power. Yet, when prices rise there are those who benefit. Who are
the winners and losers from inflation?
RICHARD NIXON: “The primary responsibility for controlling inflation rests with the
national administration.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Finally, in the 1970s, the government was pushed to take
drastic action. What was the result?
No one likes rising prices, and in the first part of the 21st Century, inflation has not been a
major factor in the economic well being of the nation. Yet in the 1970s inflation became
a fact of life despite all the clamor to do something about it. Inflation…How did the
spiral begin? With economic analyst Richard Gill we’ll explore that question on this 21st-

(INFLATION: HOW DID THE SPIRAL BEGIN? Appears on screen)
# Part I

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: What is inflation? Well, here at the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, they measure inflation, in a sense, with the consumer price index…totaling the
cost of goods and services and then comparing them from month to month and year to
year. We’ve all felt the effect of inflation. There are those among us who can look back
nostalgically on the days of the 3-cent postage stamp and the 25-cent movies. When
prices go up just a little we’re not surprised, but when they get out of hand, well then we
sit up and take notice, as we did in the late 1960s when prices began spiraling upward.
What caused that spiral? And how did inflation get out of control? As the country grew
and expanded in the 1950’s no one was very worried about inflation. Then late in the
decade the economy began to cool down, and that became a factor in the 1960 elections.
JOHN F. KENNEDY: “I’m not satisfied to have 50 percent of our steel mill capacity
unused…I’m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of
economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: President John F. Kennedy called for a “new frontier”...a
new era of energy and spirit.
JOHN F. KENNEDY: “The election may have been a close one but I think there is here
general agreement by all of our citizens that a supreme national effort will be needed in
the years ahead to move this country safely through the 1960s.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: This new activist approach was to be reflected in economic
policy. Walter Heller chaired the Council of Economic Advisors in the Kennedy
administration.
WALTER HELLER: “Kennedy was our first Keynesian president. It isn’t that others
hadn’t done some Keynesian things in terms of the way they managed the economy but

Kennedy did it in an avowed and in a perceptive way. He was very cautious at first, and
it took a while for him to see that a more liberal approach was needed to stimulate the
economy.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: It took the form of a massive tax cut proposed in 1962.
JOHN F. KENNEDY: “This net reduction in tax liabilities of 10 billion dollars will
increase the purchasing power of American families and business enterprises in every tax
bracket.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But John F. Kennedy didn’t live to see his programs
enacted. Instead, on that fateful day in November, Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in
as the 36th President of the United States. Johnson pursued Kennedy’s economic
proposals and pushed the passage of the tax plan through Congress. How well did it
work?
WALTER HELLER: “Perfectly…Business Week, which is not exactly a liberal pro-
Kennedy publication, said that it probably was the most successful tax cut in history. In a
sense, you know, it came out of the textbooks, and in a sense it went back into the
textbooks as the fiscal measure that came closer to carrying out what people had
projected for it. In terms of the economics of it…that was a tax cut that worked.”
### DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The economic policies of the Kennedy/Johnson

administration had succeeded in stimulating demand, creating growth in the economy…
Business was booming…jobs were plentiful…and unemployment was near an all-time
low. But many observers, including the President’s Council of Economic Advisors, were
now concerned about the appearance of inflation as the economy heated up. James
### Duesenberry recalls…

JAMES DUESENBERRY: “But in 1965 the real aggregate demand was rising at an
annual rate of nearly eight percent and it was continuing to rise into 1966. And that is
what produced the high capacity utilization, the rising raw materials prices and the
decline in unemployment accompanied by labor shortages.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Many economists felt a tax increase would take money out
of the hands of the consumers and business…Spending would drop…inflationary
pressures would retreat..but even as the tax measure was debated, new inflationary forces
were about to be unleashed by the White House. Lyndon Johnson didn’t want to be
bothered by warnings about inflation. Lyndon Johnson had a dream of a “Great Society.”
LYNDON B. JOHNSON: “This administration today, here and now, declares
unconditional war on poverty in America.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: LBJ began to build his “Great Society.” But the big ticket
item in the federal budget was not war on poverty…it was the war in Vietnam. The
Defense Department told the public it was spending about a billion dollars a month. We
were to find out later it was costing more…in fact between two and three times more!
WALTER HELLER: “We were not really fully aware…not even as economic advisors
in Washington, let alone those of us who were outside consultants, were not aware of
how much Vietnam was going to cost. So we were taken unawares for several months,
but by December of 1965, still early in the game, when the President had me come down
to the ranch, I urged him to go for a sizable tax increase and he said, ‘Walter, I’ve
checked on both sides of the aisle and both houses of Congress’ and he said, ‘I don’t
think I could get a dozen votes.’ ”
MYRA MACPHERSON: “The whole problem stemmed from the kind of war this war
was. It was a war that was never declared a war and one of the main problems about it
from the beginning was the idea that we would sort of run it on the cheap. That was one
of Lyndon Johnson’s great points was, ‘let’s try to run this war without letting people
know we’re at war.’ He wanted a silent, invisible war and so, therefore, he did not want
to raise taxes…that was just a total anathema to him. He wanted to do the guns and
butter…he wanted to have the domestic programs and he wanted to be able to run the war
as well.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The stage was set for the surge of inflation. In the absence
of a tax increase or any other effective restraint, consumers and businesses kept

spending…at the same time the government kept spending, so businesses operated close
to capacity and labor approached full-employment. To meet the demands of the
marketplace, expensive new factories had to be built and competition for workers bid up
wages. In short, the demand exceeded the economy’s ability to supply…and everything
began to cost more. Finally, the President declared a one-year 10 percent surtax. But
was it enough…Was it in time?
WALTER HELLER: “I don’t think he wanted to fight for a tax increase on the backs of
an unpopular war in Vietnam and so that was held off until 1967…not enacted until
1968…and the horse was out of the barn.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In the 1960s we had a classic go-go economy. Consumer
demand ran at a feverish pitch as did government spending…..and that began a cycle of
inflationary pressures that would be with us for a long long time. But does it have to be
that way? Does a booming economy necessarily go hand in hand with inflation? That’s
the question we put to economic analyst Richard Gill…
## (Music Plays - Comment & Analysis I)

(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: In the 1960s, most economists would have said: inflation occurs
when the total -- the aggregate -- demand for goods and services in the economy is
expanding faster than the aggregate supply. Everybody wants more goods...more goods
aren’t available… prices go up. Mind you, this was the period when Keynesian analysis
was at its height. These are simplified Keynesian-style aggregate demand and supply
curves…similar to, but, of course, not exactly the same as the curves we might draw for a
particular product, say, refrigerators. A major difference is that here we are dealing with
supply and demand for the total output of the nation, its GNP. And on the vertical axis,
we are now measuring not the price of refrigerators but the price of output in general, that
is the price level. Let’s concentrate on one feature of these curves…the shape of this
simplified Keynesian-style aggregate supply curve. You’ll notice it is drawn quite flat
through most of its range, until we approach this line which represents full employment

<!-- Page 7 -->

GNP, and then suddenly it goes up quite sharply. Suppose we start here…far from the
full employment line. Our level of GNP is quite low, our price level here. We now try to
increase aggregate demand. The tax-cut of 1964 giving more income to consumers
would be a perfect example. What is the result? GNP now goes up, meaning more
production and jobs for everybody. But the price level remains the same. We have
growth without inflation. But now look at what happens when we start over here. This is
what we were facing in the late 1960s. Demand was already high. The “Great Society”
programs of Lyndon Johnson had been launched, and now along comes the Vietnam
War, and suddenly demand is given a big shot in the arm. Our aggregate demand curve
shifts up here. And look at the difference: all the effect of the increasing demand goes
into higher prices. We are already producing at the economy’s capacity. Supply does not
increase. We have entered the world of demand-pull inflation. Now Keynesians felt that
the economic cure was simple. Lower demand by raising taxes. If a tax cut can raise
demand, a tax increase can reduce demand. How well this Keynesian style remedy could
have worked we can never know for certain – it wasn’t tried. What is certain is that
inflation was to become, in the years following, a much more complex - and painful -
phenomenon.
# Part Ii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Inflation…a source of anguish and despair for many as it
undermines purchasing power and eats away at savings. It’s hard to plan for inflation,
and when it spreads rapidly many are unprotected...particularly those like these people on
fixed incomes. But, as destructive as inflation can be, there are those who benefit from
unexpected rising prices. Just who are they? One answer may surprise you. People in
debt can gain from inflation…and the great middle class traditionally goes into debt to
buy a house…so when interest rates on existing mortgages are lower than the rate of
inflation, homeowners win. They pay back their loans with cheaper, inflated dollars. At
the same time, their property values rise. Along with millions of other homeowners, Mr.
and Mrs. Lawson found they had a windfall from inflation.

<!-- Page 8 -->

DAVID LAWSON: “I realize that inflation has been a serious problem for many people,
but it really hasn’t affected us too much, with our house payments remaining essentially
constant, the interest rate…it was an FHA loan of five and one quarter percent…we are
just fortunate that inflation really hasn’t bothered us very much.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: And there were other winners as well. This wave of
inflation coincided with the “credit boom” of the late ‘60s. Consumers were urged to buy
on credit. An inflationary psychology emerged. “Buy now before prices go up…pay
later with cheaper dollars.” Consumers were spending money…and the increased
demand was creating lots of jobs. So, businesses would seem to be winning, but many
soon had second thoughts.
RICHARD RAHN: “Well, business does not fare well overall during periods of
inflation. At the initial stages of inflation, when it’s increasing, some businesses think
they are better off because profits seem to rise. What you have is a situation where your
inventory cost is low, where you have purchased goods at some previous time period…
Then, suddenly, inflation comes along and you’re able to raise your prices, so it looks
like you get a bigger profit. But all of a sudden your costs then begin to soar…You have
all this uncertainty which comes along, and suddenly most businesses find themselves far
worse off. And that often leads us to recessions.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Among those clearly worse off from inflation were senior
citizens. For the most part, they lived on fixed incomes. They had no extra money to
cover even a small price increase. How could they meet raises in rents, heating bills or
food?
WALTER JONES: “It seemed that when you became old, if you had not been fortunate
enough to put aside or prepare to take care of yourself when you were aging, that you
didn’t deserve any better. And that was a common feeling.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But the “seniors” had the power to organize and to make
their voices heard.

WILLIAM HUTTON: “In those marches we achieved recognition that social security
was still inadequate. Our long goal was to try to secure a way in which we could link the
consumer price index to regular increases, so we wouldn’t have to go and beg Congress,
and beg an administration which maybe was conservative and didn’t want to give us
anything. We felt that if that was automatic with the consumer price index increases, that
would be much better…it would be less political…and we finally achieved that.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Others hit hard by inflation were the working poor and the
unemployed. Most of the little money they had went for the necessities of life and the
prices of those basics…of food, fuel and housing and health…all were rising the fastest.
Like the seniors, the poor attempted to organize to keep pace with inflation, but their
efforts were not as successful.
MICHAEL HARRINGTON: “The “senior citizen” movement, in terms of participation,
has been a much more effective movement than the poor. One of the problems with the
poor is precisely that they’re not organized…that they vote less than anybody else…that
they join groups less than anyone else. The poor are not like the organized workers.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Even the “organized worker” was having problems keeping
up. New York was only one city knocked on its heels as first the sanitation workers
struck for higher pay. Shortly afterwards, firemen and police went out on job actions.
Then came the transit strike and the teachers’ strike…each group, like so many other
Americans, fighting to hold on to a decent living. We asked Victor Gotbaum, who
represents public employees in New York, to recall those turbulent days.
VICTOR GOTBAUM: “I represent workers. If they’re taking a beating when they go
into the supermarket, I hear about it. They don’t make unfounded or loud demands. If
Vinny Perissi, who is a sewer laborer says, ‘Hey, Mary goes into that market, Vic, it’s
killing me’…that’s what I hear. If a hospital worker says, ‘You know it’s becoming
awful’…that’s what I hear.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Workers won higher settlements, but that raised costs and
boosted prices. In all sectors of the economy…in all parts of the country…inflation had

become entrenched. It was hard to keep up. It was harder to feel sure about who was
winning. The cry to do something about inflation was coming from more quarters and it
was growing louder and louder. Was there any real hope that the inflation momentum
would run out of steam...or were we just victims of our own expectations that inflation
would continue? We asked economic analyst Richard Gill…
## (Music Plays - Comment & Analysis Ii)

(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: I would say that there was relatively little hope at this time that the
inflationary momentum would run out of steam. You see, one thing that happens when
inflation gets going is that all groups feel that they are losers. Sanitation workers,
teachers, senior citizens, rich man, poor man, you name it…everybody faces these higher
prices, and thinks, my God, I’m being ruined. Now, in one sense, this perception that
everyone is losing is unjustified. If prices are going up, incomes are going up too. Not
everybody is losing all the time. There have to be winners too! Still, when this
uncertainty about the future becomes contagious…things can get bad for everybody. It’s
extremely difficult to run an efficient, productive economy when prices are changing all
the time. But whether justified or not, this fear of falling behind can unquestionably be a
major factor causing inflation to increase. The sanitation workers feel they are falling
behind. They strike and get a higher wage. But now other public employees see that
they really are falling behind. They demand even higher increases. But now other
workers…coal-miners, assembly-line workers, sales clerks…see that they are falling
behind. Up, up we go. Wages, prices, wages, prices. The spiral is upon us. How on
earth can it be stopped? By the end of the 1960’s, the question was not only real but
urgent.

importance of inflation, but by early 1969 when the inflation rate climbed to over five

percent, it could no longer be ignored. Both the business community and consumer
groups demanded that something be done. The responsibility was left to the White
House and its new occupant…Richard Milhous Nixon.
RICHARD NIXON: “The primary responsibility for controlling inflation rests with the
national administration and its handling of fiscal and monetary affairs.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But would this President be more willing than his
predecessor to accept the traditional Keynesian approach …to reduce demand by
increasing taxes? Chief Economic Advisor, Paul McCracken, explains Nixon’s
reluctance…
PAUL MCCRACKEN: “I don’t know of any political situation…short of a war…where
there isn’t enormous hesitancy about increasing taxes. That’s about the least popular
thing that the political system wants to hear.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: And increased taxes, after all, were likely not only to cut
inflation but also to slow the economy. That was a sore point for Nixon’s past. He
believed the economic “slowdown” in 1960 had cost him the Presidency…and his eye
was now on the 1972 elections. Also Nixon was a laissez faire conservative. He feared
that increased tax revenues would increase the size and the role of government. But if
taxes were not to be raised…why not cut back on federal spending?
PAUL MCCRACKEN: “It would have been irresponsible to start out with a meat
cleaver slashing everything…partly because I’m sure that a year or so later government
would be hard at work trying to increase everything they could increase…Better to stay
in the middle of the stream.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: If increasing taxes or cutting the budget were unpalatable to
Richard Nixon, perhaps the Federal Reserve could be enlisted to combat inflation. In
theory, the rate of inflation is a function of the money supply. By restricting the money
supply, inflation should also contract. The Fed cooperated. The result…

PAUL MCCRACKEN: “One thing that was expected then by economists was that the
price level would respond to restraint…monetary and fiscal restraint…much more rapidly
than in fact it did. And so there was a tendency to say, ‘well the policies are failing.’ ”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Then, as the Feds’ restrictive policies did take hold, the
economy slowed down…Unemployment mounted. There was an outcry against this
“made in Washington” recession. But inflation was barely affected. It was so entrenched
that people expected it to continue, and it did. Could stronger medicine contain it?
Critical economists and politicians called for the government to directly freeze prices and
wages. Those controls had worked during wartime to stifle inflation, but they had never
before been seriously considered in times of peace. Controlled wage and price ceilings
interfered with the “free market” and the laissez faire traditions of the country. On the
other hand, elections were just eighteen months away and something had to be done. But
could a conservative president like Richard Nixon come to accept price controls?
RICHARD NIXON: “The time has come for decisive action…action that will break the
vicious circle of spiraling prices and costs. I am today ordering a freeze on all prices and
wages throughout the United States for a period of ninety days.”
HERBERT STEIN: “We were having an inflation, before the controls, which was the
result of the expectation that inflation would go on…so people were asking for wage
increases in the expectation of inflation…and businesses were raising prices in the
expectation of inflation in their costs…and the theory was that if you could just stop this
process for a while…people would get over that expectation of inflation and you could
then resume a “free market” system with a low rate of inflation. But that didn’t
happen…We didn’t change the expectations…We only created the expectation that when
the controls ended the prices would zoom again.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: And prices did zoom up again when controls were
lifted…Price and wage controls proved ineffective, in the long run, in stopping this spiral
of inflation. And even when we did take inflation seriously, controlling it was more
easily said than done. Was there anything that could have worked? Economic analyst

## (Music Plays - Comment & Analysis Iii)

(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: The basic reason that wage and price controls were adopted was that
the traditional Keynesian remedy for inflation -- cutting back aggregate demand --
suddenly seemed inadequate to our new situation. A Keynesian-style inflation, we recall,
looks like this. Demand is too high. So we cut back…say, by raising taxes…and we
lower prices, without having any real effect on GNP or employment. But suppose our
aggregate supply curve is different from the Keynesian. Suppose that, instead of this
little upward curvature here, the whole supply curve looks like this. Suddenly we are in a
new world. Our prices are too high up here. So we cut back aggregate demand to here.
Prices do fall, but…and this is a huge but…so also does our GNP. In simple words, to
lower inflation we have had to plunge the economy into a recession. We have had to
trade off some of our employment to bring inflation down. Of course, these diagrams
present an oversimplified picture of what was going on at the time. In a general way,
however, we can say that by the early 1970s, prices had a tendency to rise well before full
employment in the economy was reached. Inflationary pressures were being felt even
when there was substantial unemployment in the economy. No wonder economists
turned from Keynesian to other remedies. And, sad to say, our problems were just
beginning.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: We learned the hard way that inflation can’t be taken
lightly. The boom of the late ‘60s may have had its positive aspects…lots of jobs and a
growing economy…but the continuing demand pulled up prices. The spiral of inflation
began and there was no quick fix. Once started, it perpetuated itself. We all learned to
live with inflation, and for some of us that meant learning to live with less…and as we
were learning to cope with inflation…it was becoming more complex. It’s hard, in this
21st Century to imagine that time when inflation was continuing to grow but demand fell
off, and the economy stagnated. We called it Stagflation…a new problem and a problem
