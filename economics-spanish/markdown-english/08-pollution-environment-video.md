DAVID SCHOUMACHER: There’s an old saying that the best things in life are free.
Things like fresh air, sunshine, clean water. A company in Minnesota found that ain’t
necessarily so. What happened? Who should pay the cost of cleaning up the
environment? And what happened when the Environmental Protection Agency ordered
Los Angeles to clean up its smog no matter what the cost? In 2009, Congress tried to
limit global warming with a new approach. Cap and Trade. - Could that work?
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Ever since the late 1960s, there has been a consensus
among Americans that the air we breathe and the water we drink should meet certain
standards. And more recently, economists and politicians have been debating how to
deal with global warming. How much is a clean environment worth? Economic analysts
Richard Gill, Nariman Behravesh and I will examine that question on this 21st-Century
edition of Economics U$A. I’m David Schoumacher.

# Part I

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The United States has always been blessed with vast natural
resources, including some things we used to take for granted… like fresh water and clean
healthy air… but not any longer. In the past few decades we've learned that industrial
activity carries with it a substantial environmental price tag. If we want fresher water and
healthier air, somebody is going to have to pay for it, as we found in the tiny town of
Silver Bay on the shores of Lake Superior.
Thirty years ago this part of Minnesota was practically a wilderness area. Then,
shortly after World War II, some far-sighted entrepreneurs decided there was
money to be made in a rock called taconite, found here in abundance near the
famous Mesabi Iron Range. They called their venture the Reserve Mining
Company. Ruth Erickson remembers the early days… before the trouble started.
RUTH ERICKSON: "Anybody that came here to work was in bad shape economically,
and Reserve built the town. They furnished us with our medical facilities, fire,
ambulance, everything. I can't say enough good things about Reserve Mining."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Taconite contains iron, not a lot, but enough to make a
profit if you know how to crush it and separate the grains of iron from the rest of the
rock, and Reserve knew how. But the refining process requires vast amounts of water
and produces two tons of sandy residue called "tailings" for every ton of iron pellets.
That creates a problem. Those "tailings" have to be put somewhere. For years
the cheapest place to put them was the lake. That upset a lot of people like
environmentalist Alden Lind.
ALDEN LIND: "The Save Lake Superior Association started in late '69 and came about
largely because of concerns of people who lived in the Silver Bay vicinity about the
impact of the tailings disposal on Lake Superior."

<!-- Page 4 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: It wasn't long before a new federal agency got involved.
### Dr. Phillip Cook remembers…

PHILIP COOK: "I think there was kind of a gut reaction of people living in the area who
were more environmentally concerned that something that big was a problem. It
didn't really, at first, have any specific concerns other than it looked like the lake
was getting cloudy and there was obvious turbidity being caused in the immediate
vicinity of the discharge. But, you're right, there was a feeling that this was a lot of
material going in the lake."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Uneasiness soon turned to fear. In 1973, word got out that
the tailings might contain asbestos, a known carcinogen. Within a few weeks, much of
the population of Duluth, 60 miles to the West, had stopped drinking tap water. But
was there a problem… or wasn't there?
PHILIP COOK: "We knew we had tailings in the water. We knew that an amphibole
material was an important fraction of these tailings particles. We knew that some
amphibole minerals, particularly the grunerite, which was in the tailings, can
occur as asbestos and that it is associated with human health hazards, particularly
for cancer. What we didn't know was whether these particular amphibole
particles in the water occurred as fibers. So we took samples of the water and
looked at it by electron microscopy and saw that indeed some of the amphibole
particles were indeed fiber shaped. That was kind of a shocking revelation to
us."
ALDEN LIND: "Oh, I think it alarmed an awful lot of people. I think the first response
was for an awful lot of people to get very active very quickly. There was a petition, I
think, with something like 10,000 names presented to the Mayor of Duluth,
insisting that something be done about this.”

<!-- Page 5 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Duluth responded by building a new filtration system. But
that didn't stop the protests.
PROTESTOR: "And we are too… we're their neighbors. We all drink out of the same
lake. It's all our country if, I don't know, people have to draw the line someplace on what
kind of environment they want to live in."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: That line was finally drawn in Federal court. For the next
four years, claim followed counterclaim.
ENVIRONMENTALIST: "The answer is definitely YES, it will delay it."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Hearing followed hearing.
### WITNESS: “No.”

### DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Environmentalists produced expert witnesses who

said the tailings were dangerous. Reserve produced experts who said they
were not… and hinted that they might be forced to shut down the plant if denied
access to the lake. Silver Bay residents saw an economic catastrophe in the
making.
RUTH ERICKSON: "One industry town… Everything is dependent upon Reserve
### Mining operating…"

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In 1977, the Federal court handed down its decision. After
years of legal maneuvering by all parties, Reserve reluctantly agreed to keep the Silver
Bay plant open and to build a tailings disposal sight seven miles inland from the
lake at a cost of nearly $400,000,000.

<!-- Page 6 -->

INTERVIEWEE: "I really have nothing to say at this time."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Today, the water in these parts is certainly cleaner than it
used to be, and probably safer. And Reserve is still in the taconite processing business,
with all the economic benefits it brings to Silver Bay. But the solution to the problem
didn't come cheap, and it might not have come at all, if the courts hadn't intervened.
The results of the Reserve Mining case show that society was no longer willing to
take a vast natural resource such as Lake Superior for granted, and it also
showed that the courts were now willing to force business to spend large
amounts of money, in this instance hundreds of millions of dollars, to clean up
their act. The case also illustrated the way the American economy in the past
had permitted business to overlook the social and environmental cost of industrial
enterprise, costs which don't often show up in a firm's bottom line. We asked economic
analyst Richard Gill to explain why the government should get involved in cases such as
this.
# (Music Plays)

(COMMENT & ANALYSIS; ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: The government has to get involved because a market economy can't
handle them. Even the most devout proponents of a private free enterprise system
recognize the need for public intervention in situations like that illustrated by the
Reserve Mining case.
Technically speaking, the problem is what economists call "negative externalities" of
production. This is rather fancy jargon, but the central idea is clear. When a business
firm produces iron, or any other product, it has certain costs: wages, rent for land, and so
on, that it has to pay for. But it also may impose other costs on society, in this case the
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 7 -->

pollution of Lake Superior for which it does not have to pay.
These costs are "external" to the firm and, indeed, "external" to the supply-and-demand
price system generally. This is important because usually economists are quite impressed
by the efficiency of the price system. When we draw supply and demand curves for a
particular product, we are not only determining the price of the product here and the
quantity of the product produced here, but we are also making a statement about costs
and benefits. Roughly speaking, this demand curve shows how much we consumers
want the product, and this supply curve tells us how much it costs the society in terms of
scarce resources to produce the product. At the intersection of the two curves, the market
exactly balances the added satisfaction we get from the product with the added cost of
producing it. Utopia!
But hardly Utopia when we take a swim in a befouled lake or, as one songwriter put it,
when we "brush our teeth with industrial sludge!" These external costs change the whole
picture. For from the society's point of view, the real costs of producing this product are
not reflected in this private supply curve but by another curve up here or even way up
here. And the problem with this new curve is that private business firms don't have to
take it into account. They don't have to pay these additional costs. And this is why the
government has to step in. Though how it should step in is a slightly tricky matter!
# Part Ii

### CROWD CHANTING: “Save our earth! Save our earth!”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: 1970 marked a turning point in this country's battle against
pollution. People were upset about America's deteriorating environment. They let our
lawmakers know how they felt on April 22, Earth Day. Congress quickly passed a series
of amendments to the Clean Air Act, which established higher air quality standards
and faster timetables to reach them. They also created an agency to enforce the new laws.

# Richard Nixon:

And in swearing in Mr. Ruckelshaus, I know that the Attorney General is very sorry
to lose him, but the nation is very fortunate to get him as the first administrator
of this vitally important agency."
# William Ruckelshaus:

"I am very honored, Mr. President. I promise to do the best job that I possibly
can."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: “Was the feeling back then that you could do a 100 percent
job of cleaning up the environment?”
WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: "Yes, and a lot of that is reflected in the laws that are still
on the books. There was a sense that we knew what the bad pollutants were, we knew
how to measure them, we knew what the health and environmental effects of those
pollutants were, we had technology that was reasonably available at a reasonable
cost to essentially eliminate that pollution. That was, all of that were assumptions written
into the law at the time and many of those assumptions are still there, and by the way,
they were all wrong."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: “Let's take the Clean Air Act, the intent to eliminate smog.
### How was that supposed to work?”

WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: "Well, the elements of smog are nitrogen oxide and
hydrocarbons that interact in sunlight. They combine in sunlight and cause
photochemical oxidants, or…smog. Now, those two pollutants, hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides, come primarily in places like Los Angeles from mobile sources --
automobiles."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But how was the EPA supposed to eliminate smog from a
city where the "car is king?" County Supervisor, Kenneth Hahn, had been wrestling with
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 9 -->

the problem for years.
KENNETH HAHN: "Well, people in Los Angeles love cars. You grow up liking cars.
You go over to a high school, you'll see more cars in the parking lot than you do bicycles.
Los Angeles County has got 5 million trucks, buses, automobiles, motorcycles…
motor vehicles polluting the air. We're in the "big garage." No wonder on certain days
people say the smog is harmful to their health. It is."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: A neighboring community turned around and sued Los
Angeles saying, 'you're dumping on us.' What was that all about?
WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: "It was Riverside, just north of Los Angeles. This was
back in the early 70's. The parents of the children who couldn't play football in the
afternoon because the smog levels were so high that they were ordered indoors finally got
agitated enough that they sued the city. They sued the Federal Government. I was
ordered by a court out there to impose, as the Clean Air Act told me to, a
transportation control strategy. They said the automobile controls are not going
to make it by 1975. The law says you have to ensure that these standards are met
by that period and if you can't do it by imposing the controls on the automobile,
then impose transportation controls. We couldn't figure out what to do. The
court threatened to hold me in contempt. It sort of boiled down to an issue of
their mobility vs. my freedom, so I few out there and announced that 80% of the
cars were going to have to get off the road.”
WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: “ I am here in Los Angeles because, in the
implementation of the Clean Air Act, Los Angeles is really in a unique position. There
are other cities…”
# David Schoumacher:

The EPA's plan wasn't greeted with much enthusiasm.

<!-- Page 10 -->

KENNETH HAHN: "It would have been a federal disaster. It would be as bad as a
hurricane or a flood or an earthquake to tell the people they can't use their automobiles to
go to work or go to school or go to church. It's crazy."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The Chamber of Commerce out there calculated that
400,000 jobs would be lost and there'd be billions of dollars of adverse effect to the
economy. Had EPA made any kind of calculation on that?
WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: "Out of the Clean Air Act we were not allowed to take
that into account in announcing a transportation or land-use control that would achieve
the standard. Removing that number of cars would have just devastated it
economically. The air would have been cleaner, but there wouldn't have been,
people wouldn't have been able to get to hospitals and other things.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But what was the philosophy behind the law that said 'we
don't want to count costs." I mean, how did we get to that point?
WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: "The philosophy is just as I stated at the outset, that we
thought we knew what the bad pollutants were, that we knew how to measure them, we
knew the level at which health and environmental effects occurred. We could get them
below that level with a margin of safety. And we had the technology that could achieve
that at a reasonable cost. All those assumptions are wrong. And if those assumptions are
wrong, then the law that embodies those assumptions is bound to drive us to an irrational
result and it's just particularly obvious in a case like Los Angeles."
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: As it turned out, the law that drove us to an irrational result
was amended. Los Angeles was given a waiver, which allowed the city more time to
clean up the air and lowered the standards it was expected to meet. Today, the city of the
angels drives on and on. The air isn't as clean as it would have been with 80% of the cars
off the road, but neither is Los Angeles an economic basket case. The story of Los
Angeles vs. smog was only one of many conflicts that developed during the 1970s.

<!-- Page 11 -->

Cleaning up the environment, no matter how beneficial, wasn't going to be as easy or as
cheap as we first thought. But does that mean we shouldn't try to clean up pollution?
What are the economic principles involved? We asked economic analyst, Richard Gill.
(MUSIC PLAYS -- COMMENT & ANALYSIS ) Economics U$A LOGO
RICHARD GILL: Well, one principle economists don't think too highly of is what we
might call the "principle of perfection." It's a natural approach. We have these harmful
external effects. Let's get rid of them, no matter what the cost. The 1973 plan for Los
Angeles was a little like this: Smog is harmful to your health. Let's get rid of it, virtually
outlaw driving for six months of the year. There are countless examples of this approach.
Nuclear generating plants involve certain hazards. Let's ban them completely. Alcohol
leads to driving fatalities. Let's bring back prohibition!
The trouble with this approach is not only that it usually doesn't work--the Los Angeles
plan had to be modified--but that it's bad economics. In our society, clean air has become
a product. It brings us certain benefits but it also has certain costs of production, and
what economists want to do is to measure these benefits against these costs, taking, of
course, all external effects into account.
These look like ordinary supply and demand curves for our product, "cleaner air,"
measured by some reduction of particulate matter, noxious fumes and the like. But these
curves do take external effects into account and are curves of social benefit and social
costs. More accurately, marginal social benefit (MSB) and marginal social cost (MSC).
What these curves tell us is that as we produce cleaner and cleaner air, moving towards
the right, the added social benefits begin to decline and the added social costs begin to
rise.
This makes sense intuitively, I think. Reducing the first and worst air-pollution brings us
a lot of social benefit: getting extremely clean air is somewhat less important. Also, as
the Los Angeles case shows, producing somewhat cleaner air is not too expensive, while
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 12 -->

producing very very clean air would have been disastrously costly. So what the
economist says is apparently fairly simple: keep on cleaning up the air until the added,
the marginal social costs begin to exceed the added, the marginal social benefits… until
the intersection of these two curves.
I say, "apparently simple," because measuring these social costs and benefits is not
always that easy.
# Part Iii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Most scientists agree that our planet is warming due to
greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Weather patterns are
more unpredictable as a result of this climate change. But what, if anything, could be
done about the problem? That provoked a heated debate.
ERIC POOLEY: “You had people like the National Association of Manufacturers and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce saying ‘if we act on climate change, if we reduce
emissions, we’re going to lose those 20th-century jobs.’ And then you had another group,
the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, saying, ‘if we don’t act we’re going to lose 21st-
century jobs.’ ”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Passage of comprehensive energy legislation that employed
a cap and trade system seemed to be the right course to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
for many.
A cap and trade system was first used, with great success, to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions under the rules of the Clean Air Act of 1990. But would a cap and trade
system reduce carbon emissions without destabilizing utilities, manufacturing centers,
and the American economy? And who would support it?
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 13 -->

TOM WILLIAMS: There was a hard cap on emissions. The environmental groups
wanted that, we wanted that. That’s how the cap and trade system works. You have a
hard cap that’s ratcheted down over time, and ultimately, by 2050, you will reduce your
greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: And there were other advantages as well.
ERIC POOLEY: “I’ve got to reduce my emissions or I’ve got to buy more allowances on
the market. Now if I can reduce those emissions myself and I don’t need all those
permits, I can sell them, because they have an economic value.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Cap and trade would give the federal government the duty
of determining a limit, or cap, on allowable amounts of greenhouse gas emissions for
utility companies and heavy manufacturing centers. How would that suit the needs of
energy companies?
TOM WILLIAMS: “Power plants are typically built for a 30-50 year time horizon. So
you really need to know what the rules are long term to succeed in that environment.”
### BARACK OBAMA: “…so help me, God…

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: When an energy-bill friendly President took office in 2009,
the timing seemed right.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In 2009, The American Clean Energy and Security Act,
comprehensive energy legislation based on a cap and trade blueprint, was floated by
Congressman Henry Waxman of California and Congressman Ed Markey of
Massachusetts.

<!-- Page 14 -->

ERIC POOLEY: “And they were very, very smart because they went to the center.
They went to where the compromise had already been fashioned between industry and
the environmental groups. And they used that as the basis of their bill.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Momentum grew for passage of the bill, as did its
complexity. It was rushed to the floor of the House of Representatives for debate as
supporters scrambled to secure the votes needed for a majority.
HENRY WAXMAN: “Today we’re taking a decisive and historic action to promote
### America’s energy security.”

JOHN DINGELL: “This bill gives certainty to American industry. Without this
certainty, new expansion and new investment in this difficult time is not going to
occur…”
RICK BOUCHER : “It achieves broad reductions in greenhouse gases. It enhances
America’s energy security, and, by placing a price on carbon dioxide emissions, will
unleash investments in clean energy technologies that will create millions of new
### American jobs.”

PETE SESSIONS: “The Democrats’ answer to the worst recession in decades is a
national energy tax, thinly disguised as a climate change bill.”
JOHN BOEHNER: “What we have on the floor today is typical big government. And
the fight that we have between the two sides of the aisle really boils down to one word. It
boils down to ‘freedom,’ the freedom to allow the American people to live their lives
without all of these extra taxes and all of this bureaucracy.”
TED POE: “We’re going to close America’s energy with this bill. The CBO and the
EPA says there’s not going to be much difference in the climate if we pass this deal.
### Bummer. It’s not even going to work.”

<!-- Page 15 -->

ED PERLMUTTER: “My friend Mr. Poe from Texas says ‘just vote no.’ Well, that’s
the party of the status quo. ‘Just vote no, we like the status quo.’ It is time for a change,
ladies and gentlemen.”
FLOOR SPEAKER: “Yeas are 219. Nays are 212. The Bill is passed.”
ERIC POOLEY: “It was the first time that either the House or the Senate had passed a
serious piece of climate legislation. It was a historic moment.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The bill moved to the Senate. And complicating matters
further, the unemployment rate was high and the economy was still struggling to recover
from the worst recession in seventy years. A Republican-led filibuster ensued.
EDWARD MARKEY: “And, ultimately, the Republican leadership then used the sixty-
vote rule in the Senate as a way of engaging in obdurate, obstinate opposition to this
legislation passing. And time was their friend. “
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Energy legislation passed out of committee in the Senate
but never reached the floor for debate. Done in by politics, energy legislation died.
We’ll never know the effect this version of carbon dioxide reduction legislation would
have had on utility companies and heavy manufacturing centers or whether it would have
been a boon or a boondoggle for the American economy. We asked economic analyst
Nariman Bahrevesh to comment.
(MUSIC PLAYS -- COMMENT & ANALYSIS ) Economics U$A LOGO
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: Economists like cap and trade systems because they use the
market place to determine the optimum balance between the costs and benefits of cutting
pollution. The government sets the hard target or cap on pollution by issuing a limited
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 16 -->

number of permits. These permits are then auctioned off. The more emissions an
industry has, the higher its demand for permits and the higher the price it is willing to
pay––up to a point. That price point is a pretty good indicator of where the costs and
benefits of pollution abatement balance out. A well-designed cap and trade system on
greenhouse emissions is the equivalent of a tax on carbon. Most economists believe that
taxes on consumption–and, especially, on pollution–are better than taxes on income. In
retrospect, cap-and-trade in the U.S. might have been more politically acceptable if it had
been accompanied by equivalent cuts in income, corporate, or payroll taxes.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: America didn’t get dirty overnight. And it’s not going to be
totally pure tomorrow. But thanks to public concern and government response, the
country’s environment is cleaner and healthier than it was back in 1970 when we first
celebrated Earth Day. Today, given the warnings about climate change, the challenges
are even greater. We have learned that if we want a cleaner world the way to get it may
not be to cleanup every last bit of the environment, but instead to look for levels of
change that provide adequate safety at a price we can afford. For this 21st-Century
Edition of Economics U$A, I’m David Schoumacher.
