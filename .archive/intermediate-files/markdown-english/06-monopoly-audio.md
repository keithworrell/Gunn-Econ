FRANK STASIO: Economics U$A, one of a series of programs designed to explore
twentieth-century micro and macroeconomic principles. The subject of this edition is
monopoly. Our guest is Doctor Thomas Kratinaker, Law Professor at Georgetown
University. I’m Frank Stasio.

FRANK STASIO: 1865. The Civil War has ended. Slavery is abolished. In the south,
plantation owners start from scratch grappling with the realities of a new economy, but in
the north where the industrial revolution had begun to reshape the economy a generation
earlier, the end of the war meant a return to unfettered growth driven by technological
changes. In the twenty-five years after the Civil War the railroads laid more than one
hundred thirty thousand miles of track stretching America’s frontiers and expanding the
reach of individual businesses and industries. Now it was possible for a single
manufacturer to transport goods cheaply and quickly almost anywhere in the country.
With the prospect of expanded sales, a business could step up production and take
advantage of the cost savings enjoyed at higher levels of output. These are known as

economies of scale. Then, going beyond economies of scale these growing firms merged
to become giant trusts. Many would gain almost complete control of their market.
Thomas Kratinaker is a Georgetown University Law Professor specializing in anti-trust
law.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “As the economy was getting bigger, it was becoming
possible to reap great rewards if you could form a trust, because instead of monopolizing
say a thousand units a year, you might be able to monopolize say, ten thousand units a
year or more.”
FRANK STASIO: This was also a time when cities began to attract growing numbers of
people. The urban population grew by four percent a year just after the Civil War. By
1880 the growth rate was six percent. At the turn of the century two-fifths of the nation’s
population lived in cities. As the population consolidated so did business. It was now
possible for one or two big firms to meet demands that at one time required dozens or
even hundreds of companies, so little firms were swallowed up by big companies, and big
companies became giant trusts. U.S. Steel had absorbed more than two hundred
companies and picked up nearly seventy percent of the steel market in the process.
America Tobacco took control of ninety percent of the market after buying out more than
a hundred fifty independent firms. American industry tumbled into a new order with
mergers taking place at an astonishing rate. There were nearly twenty times as many
mergers in Nineteen Hundred as there were just three years earlier.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “So we saw during the 1880s the creation of a whole bunch
of Trusts, many of which sound somewhat whimsical today. I mean there was the Sugar
Trust, then the Whiskey Trust. You can probably empathize with those, but there was
also a Paper Bag Trust and there was an Envelope Trust, and an Oil Cloth and Painting
### Pitch Trust.”

FRANK STASIO: By 1904, 40 percent of the nation’s industrial output was produced by
less than one percent of all the businesses in the country. Companies like U.S. Steel,

American Tobacco, and Standard Oil had eliminated virtually all the competition in their
fields. It was a dream come true.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “Competition is good for consumers but it’s bad for
businesses. Competition has the effect of driving prices down. Anybody who’s in
business would rather be a monopolist than a competitor. The point of a trust or
a…which is really just one way of creating a one-firm monopoly or merging all the
competitors in one industry, is to enable them to gain control of all the output so that they
can cut back on what’s being produced and raise prices to consumers.”
FRANK STASIO: Notice that Professor Kratinaker doesn’t simply say the monopolist
dictates prices. He said that once a firm gains complete control of a market, it will cut
back on production. It’s only by keeping output artificially low that the monopolist can
command higher prices.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “The whole concept of a monopoly is to try to restrict the
amount that’s being supplied in order to charge higher prices and try to be
making…trying to charge prices that substantially exceed the costs of production. Even a
monopolist has always got a choice between expanding output and raising prices. He
doesn’t usually have the opportunity to follow both those course of action. I mean, the
reason it’s assumed that you’ll sell more when you lower price is that then people will
substitute away from some other product to your product. And similarly if you raise
price, you’re likely to lose customers because they’ll find something else to substitute. I
guess the Paper Bag Trust when it raised its prices found that people were going back
to…back to cloth sacks.”
FRANK STASIO: So, under a monopoly output is usually less than it might be under a
perfectly competitive system, but how does the monopolist know when the ideal output
level has been reached. To find this, the monopolist looks at the cost of making each
additional unit and the revenue he’ll receive from the sale of those additional units.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “The uh, monopolist wants to look at how much additional
costs it will have to bear in order to produce more of a good and compare that to the
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 5 -->

additional revenue it will…it will derive from producing that good, and it’s only where
those two come into balance or as the economists would say at the equilibrium that the
monopolist will stop. At that point it will stop expanding output and will…and will
charge a price where its marginal costs as we’ve just defined equal its marginal revenue
as we’ve just defined them. At that point it will turn out that the monopolist is in fact
charging more total price than it is expending in total cost for the output.”
FRANK STASIO: Clearly the monopolist has an advantage over other businesses in
more competitive fields.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “If you’re in a competitive market, maximizing your profits
means cutting your costs and selling as much as you can, because in the competitive
market you don’t have much influence over price. Um, there are so many firms out there
that your decision as to how you produce doesn’t really affect the total price that the
commodity fetches in the marketplace. A monopolist following the same incentives, that
is, maximize its profits, faces a different set of conditions. A monopolist knows that if it
restricts output price will rise because it’s the only supplier of that good. So that what a
monopolist is trying to do is to find that point at which it makes the largest total profits.
What that means is it wants the highest gap between its costs of production and the price
at which it sells the good.”
FRANK STASIO: Because it doesn’t have to worry about competition, a monopolist can
earn a higher profit margin than firms that have to compete for their share of the market.
The higher return on a monopolist investment is called economic profit. Professor
Kratinaker explains the difference between economic profit and simple profit.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “If you’re operating a bowling alley, it’s not true that your
profit is all the money left over after you buy the pins and the balls and the machines. If
you have ten dollars left over, maybe instead of buying bowling alleys you could have
bought a Certificate of Deposit and made eleven dollars. If so, you shouldn’t be owning
a bowling alley, you ought to have the Certificates of Deposit. It was a cost to you to a
cost of capital to make the average rate of return in society. So that for a lay person profit

<!-- Page 6 -->

is just what’s left over after costs, but for an economist and the notion of economic profit
is that amount of money which you make which is above and beyond the ordinary rate of
return made in average capital markets. In a sense, the whole definition of a monopoly is
that that’s a firm which has the option to earn economic profit.”
FRANK STASIO: We’ve already seen how economies of scale and mergers help to
create monopolies. There are other reasons as well. One way is to control the technology
in an industry through patents.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “The patent that the government gives to the discoverer of
an invention gives that discoverer the right to exclude anyone else from making the
product. That individual then has a monopoly. But the purpose here, at least the stated
purpose isn’t to protect existing manufacturers or some other rationale that might be
given for other kinds of monopoly protective devices but to encourage people to invent,
and the patent has been a more or less time-honored device for trying to encourage
invention.”
FRANK STASIO: Another way to build a monopoly is to get control of the inputs, that
is, the raw materials or products needed to manufacture a particular product.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “Uh, this is much what…like what the firms try to do in the
Standard Oil case, which was one of the large early Sherman Act cases. That is, they
tried to gain monopoly over the sale of gasoline and other refined oil products by gaining
control of the oil fields and of the pipelines that were sending oil from the oil fields to the
refineries.”
FRANK STASIO: It wasn’t long before the market power exercised by the industrial
giants produced resentment and mistrust. Farmers were the first to feel the pinch when
they tried to ship their goods or borrow money. Many joined the Farmer’s Grange and
other organizations so they might pressure government to restrain the colossal trusts.
Soon small businesses claimed they were squeezed out by unfair competition, and finally
consumers felt the trust kept prices artificially high. The government responded quickly.
In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.

<!-- Page 7 -->

THOMAS KRATINAKER: The Sherman Anti-Trust Act is somewhat obscured in
history today. To tell you precisely why it was passed would be a very difficult thing, but
some things I think we could still say with a fair degree of certainty. First of all, it
certainly was a response to popular pressure. There isn’t any question that large numbers
of American people whether it was fifty percent or eight percent or forty-two percent I
can’t say, but large numbers of just ordinary regular American citizens thought that the
problem of monopolies or as they were referred to in those days as the trust was a large
problem that was threatening the American economy and was threatening to wreak great
harm on American consumers. Um, and that was principally the impetus behind the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act. And if you read the Act you could almost see that because the
Act says almost nothing. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act simply says it’s an offense to
engage in a restraint of trade and it’s an offense to monopolize. Um, that’s literally what
it says. As a matter of practice what it’s saying is, federal courts, we got a problem. We
hereby declare that, in general, we are opposed to monopoly and we prefer competition,
will you please figure out a solution to it.”
FRANK STASIO: While the Sherman Act was vague about what would and would not
constitute a monopoly, Kratinaker says the legislation reinforced a uniquely American
economic tradition.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: What the Sherman Act did was not so much respond to the
grangers or respond to the trusts as to re-express in ways that are in many other places in
the American political economy such as the First Amendment a belief in marketplace, a
belief in individual control of our own destiny. Uh, most other civilized countries in
response to a phenomenon like the trusts would have imposed a form of regulation that
would moderate disputes between the trusts and consumers. The trusts would have kept
some of their profits, and the consumers would have gotten somewhat lower prices. Thus
it would have perceived that, well, they’ve got their business and there are consumers out
there, we’ve got to just make sure that nobody’s completely ripping off somebody else,
but if they want to form a trust that’s okay by us. Um, that wasn’t the American reaction.
### The American reaction was to stress consumer sovereignty.”

FRANK STASIO: As a restatement of American values, the Sherman Act is an
interesting piece of legislation but as a tool for breaking up monopolies and preserving
competition, it was considerably less important. The Act never spelled out what practices
were illegal nor did it give the government any new powers to prosecute suspected
wrongdoers.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “The courts responded to the anti-trust law in ways that you
might expect confronted with this very short, very vague statute. They started off in
about five different directions at once, and some judges told us that every time anybody
restrains trade that violates the Sherman Act. Other judges realized that if I were to sell a
watch to you, that might be characterized as a restraint of trade because now someone
else can no longer buy that watch from me, so in that sense there’s a restrain of free trade
in the watch. He said, ‘well it can’t be that the Act literally means what it means.
Perhaps it depends on the size of the company involved. Perhaps other courts might have
suggested it depends on the purpose for which they act.’ Uh, others suggested it might
depend on trying to guess what effect was going to occur. Are consumers gonna suffer
higher prices or are competitors gonna be driven out of business? Um, we saw all these
starts as time went by and as courts had more experience and more time to think about
the job they’d been given, they began to refine the inquiry a bit, so that for example we
no longer talk about any kind of literal reading of the statute. Um, the courts will by and
large tell you that the Act is designed to protect competition, not competitors. That is, we
worry about consumers being hurt. We’re not too worried about an action that only has
the effect of injuring a business.”
FRANK STASIO: In effect, there were two ways to look at trusts. The courts could
focus either on the firm’s market performance or its market structure. Market
performance centers on the company’s behavior whereas Kratinaker says the company
has formed a monopoly just to make excessive profits which would be illegal or because
of technological innovations or business efficiencies which the courts might permit. The
court could then look at whether the firm is charging a fair price for it product. The other
way of examining trusts, the market structure approach, ignores all of that and simply
looks at whether or not the firm has taken complete or near complete control of the

market. The case against Standard Oil in 1911 established the market performance
criterion as the standard for deciding anti-trust cases for more than thirty years.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “In that case the court said, look, what we have is a rule of
reason. That which unreasonably restrains trade is unlawful and that which does not
unreasonably restrain trade is not unlawful, and so people stopped worrying about the
precise language of the anti-trust laws and started worrying about what’s a reasonable
and what’s an unreasonable restraint of trade.”
FRANK STASIO: The rule of reason was modified somewhat in 1945 when a federal
judge ruled that the Alcoa Aluminum Company was an illegal monopoly even though it
was not found to be engaging in any practices that would be considered illegal under
market performance guidelines.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “That decision seemed to establish the proposition that the
Sherman Act’s prohibition on monopolies went beyond its prohibition on unreasonable
restraints of trade. Uh, a firm that acquired a monopoly was to be broken up or to be
punished in some way whether or not it had engaged in any illegal acts along the way.
Uh, now at the same time the author of the Opinion, Judge Leonard Hand, said that he
was not saying that someone that invents a better mousetrap is to be consigned to Haiti’s,
but was trying to walk some kind of a fine line between the firm that gains a monopoly
by what he described as maneuvers honestly industrial or superior skill foresight in
industry on the one hand. Those would continue to be lawful monopolies, but on the
other hand those monopolies who acquired a position of dominance but not by means that
were as he put it, economically inevitable, were to be treated as unlawful monopolies.”
FRANK STASIO: It has taken decades to develop a meaningful interpretation of the
Sherman Act. In the year shortly after its passage few trusts were ever taken to court.
The great trust buster himself, Teddy Roosevelt, prosecuted only sixteen cases during his
administration. The generally mixed record of enforcement under the Sherman Act led to
passage of tougher legislation in 1914. The Clayton Anti-Trust Act and the Federal
Trade Commission Act.

<!-- Page 10 -->

THOMAS KRATINAKER: “The Clayton Act or something like it was part of Wilson’s
platform when he ran for the Presidency in 1912 and one of the principal…there were
two principal themes that were being expressed both of which grew out of the vagueness
of the Sherman Act. To consumers and to consumer action groups Wilson was saying
there are certain kinds of practices that are pernicious that we ought to be condemning
them out of hand, and the Sherman Act doesn’t admit of that kind of treatment ‘cause the
courts are always asking about purpose and effect. So we’ve got to tighten up the
anti-trust laws by specifically defining certain kinds of things like pie in arrangements,
price discrimination and mergers that are inherently harmful to consumers. This was an
idea that was largely the brainchild…of… the brainstorm, excuse me of…of Louis
Brandeis. Um, the second thing that Wilson was saying was directed at businesses. This
was not Brandeis’s idea. Um, others had it but it was the vagueness of the Sherman Act
means that business people are every day at risk as to whether or not they’re violation the
Sherman Act. They deserve to have more specific guidance. Why don’t we create an
expert administrative agency that can use fact-finding and rule-making procedures to
specify under what circumstances a restraint of trade is unreasonable or wonder what
circumstances this behavior might be deemed to be an attempt to monopolize? These two
ideas give guidance to business and let’s put some teeth behind certain kinds of
prescriptions of anti-trust activity coalesced in the joint enactment…I mean, they
occurred at virtually the same time…of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the
### Clayton Act.”

FRANK STASIO: Even with the Clayton Act, however, the government never tried to
outlaw monopolies completely. There are some industries where you and I recognize we
are better served by one large company than several smaller ones all competing for our
business. In many cases, these businesses are called natural monopolies. One of the
ways to determine if a firm is a natural monopoly is to see whether costs will continue to
decline as production increases. If a firm can lower costs by serving an entire market as
in the case of public utilities, it’s considered a natural monopoly. But left to its own, a
natural monopoly would act like any other company with complete control of the market.
It would restrict output to keep prices and therefore, profits high. But as we’ve heard it
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 11 -->

would be in no one’s interest to force competition of these industries, so rather than break
up a natural monopoly, the government often decides to regulate it.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “Usually what the government does is to try to force that
company by detailed regulation to not to cut its output but to continue to expand its
output to the point where it would be producing if it were in a competitive situation. That
means continuing to sell so long as all of its costs are covered by the total receipts that
it’s…that it’s gaining from consumers.”
FEMALE VOICE: “I urge you to deny the rate increase in total and deny the request to
restructure rates.”
MALE VOICE: “These proposals are a blatant attempt to simply gouge the public, the
taxpayers, those who work for a living, and those on fixed incomes.”
FRANK STASIO: There are regulatory commissions at every level of government that
oversee natural monopolies. These commissions set prices by allowing the firm a fair
rate of return on its investment. That is, a fair profit based on the total costs and output.
Public regulation has its critics. Some people charge that regulatory commissions get too
close to the industry they oversee and often allow higher profits than necessary. Others
complain that the cost of regulating an industry exceeds the benefits.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “There’s a school of thought that when you add in the cost
of regulation, the cost of the lawyers, the cost of the regulatory agency, the court costs
that are consumed in judicial review…you’re lucky if you wind up with a net plus.”
FRANK STASIO: Another criticism of regulated monopolies is that they offer little
incentive for innovation or efficiency. As long as it’s guaranteed a profit, the firm is not
penalized for letting costs get too high.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “As one wag put it I wish I could take credit for it, one of
the rewards of a monopoly is the quiet life. A monopolist may not only raise price but
may also be lax in controlling costs. You may decide you can afford to put your nephew

<!-- Page 12 -->

on the payroll, and you can…and you can pay your brother-in-law the stockholder-
inflated rates of return because you don’t face any competition.”
FRANK STASIO: It’s important to note that accepting industries where we find natural
monopolies, it’s nearly impossible for one company to gain complete control of a market
without the help of government.
### THOMAS KRATINAKER: “For example, suppose everybody…all the automobile

manufacturers in America got together and merged into one firm and then started to
restrict output and raise prices. Well, they’d be an effective monopoly only if somebody
else didn’t start up another automobile company seeing that there are these profits to be
made or only if we didn’t start having massive amounts of automobiles shipped in from
Japan or Europe. Um, keeping people out of the American market either from building
firms here or from supplying or from exporting goods from abroad usually requires active
governmental protection.”
FRANK STASIO: Also bear in mind that while government may allow a monopoly to
do business, the approval isn’t always permanent. A monopoly may lose its protected
status when technological changes make competition feasible.
JACK GOEKEN: “If I came up with this idea to put this microwave from Chicago to St.
Louis, not to compete with AT&T but to uh, expand our two-way uh, radio business, find
more customers. So uh, we filed an application with the uh, FCC and uh, oh, what in a
few weeks AT&T, Illinois Bell, Southwestern Bell, General Telephone Electronics, and
Western Union all filed petitions to deny our applications.”
FRANK STASIO: That’s Jack Goeken, one of the founders of MCI Corporation.
Goeken soon learned why the phone company objected to his application. If permitted, it
would break Bell’s monopoly on long distance communication. Henry Geller was
General Counsel for the Federal Communications Commission.
HENRY GELLER: “What you had was a revolution in how telecommunications went
about its business of switching and of communicating between points and the revolution,

<!-- Page 13 -->

the computer, the microwave, the satellite, were really available to everybody. It wasn’t
like stringing a wire, and that made possible the competition.”
FRANK STASIO: MCI was successful and Ma Bell’s monopoly over long distance
communication was over. The growth of MCI and other long distance carriers seems to
prove the theory that monopolies will be tolerated only as long as they clearly serve the
best interest to the general public. There is an argument for encouraging the spread of
monopolies generally across the economy. Proponents suggest that there are long-term
benefits to consumers that outweigh the short-term costs brought on by restricted supply.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “Real growth in the American economy comes, in any
economy, comes from innovation, real innovation, breath-taking innovation like the
automobile. No more horse and buggy. Let’s go to automobiles. Or like the airplane.
Forget covered wagons, we’re flying to California. That’s a very big deal. It’s not such a
big deal to get the price of watchbands down from a dollar to ninety-eight cents, as
competition will do. The argument is that a monopolist has the luxury, the resources, and
the time to invest money in fundamental research and development that a competitive
firm may not have time for and eventually that any kind of harm that’s done to consumers
is a short-term harm. Meanwhile what you’re hoping for is that that firm with a
monopoly on horse and buggies may have the luxury and the wherewithal to invent the
### Model T.”

FRANK STASIO: Let’s look back now at some of the ways monopolies gain control
over their markets and how governments deal with them. A monopoly is a market with a
single seller. Once a business has control of the market it will tend to restrict supply to
keep prices high. Near the turn of the century some businessmen took advantage of
economies of scale and general economic growth in the United States and built trusts,
which gained almost complete control of their markets. Complaints that Trusts charged
unfair prices began with farmers and quickly spread throughout the population. The
government responded by passing the Sherman Anti-Trust Act in 1890. The Sherman
Act merely reinforced the common law principles against restraint of trade. Few Trusts
were prosecuted under the Sherman Act in the year shortly after its passage. In 1914,
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 14 -->

Congress passed the Clayton Anti-Trust Act, which specified practices which were
illegal. The Federal Trade Commission Act, also passed in 1914, set up the Federal
Trade Commission with authority to regulate business competition. There are two ways
to view anti-trust policy. One is to aim at the firm’s behavior to determine whether its
actions hurt consumers. This is called the market performance approach. The other
method is to use the firm’s position in the market as the sole basis to make a ruling. This
is called the market structure approach. A monopoly can occur because of patents,
control of inputs and government action. Economies of scale also assist in developing a
monopoly. If a firm can lower costs by serving an entire market, it’s called a natural
monopoly. For such a market it may not be desirable to maintain competition and the
public may insist on a government regulated monopoly. Public utilities are examples of
natural monopolies. They’re usually regulated by a public agency, which decides the
output and the rates a utility may charge. The regulatory agency allows the monopoly a
fair rate of return on its investment based on total costs and demand. Regulated
monopolies are often criticized for the rates they charge. Some critics say regulatory
agencies give in too easily to the businesses they oversee. Some question whether the
cost of regulating a monopoly is worth the benefits. Finally, since regulated monopolies
are guaranteed a profit, critics charge that there is little incentive for cost efficiency.
While monopolies tend to restrict supply and charge higher prices then if they were in a
more competitive environment, there is an argument that monopolists may use their
higher profits and freedom from concerns of competition to invest in basis research that
could lead to dramatic innovation.
