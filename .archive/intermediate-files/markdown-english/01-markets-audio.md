FRANK STASIO: Economics U$A. One of a series of programs designed to explore
twentieth-century micro and macroeconomic principles. The subject of this edition is
Markets and Prices. Our guest is Herbert Levine, Professor of Economics at the
University of Pennsylvania. I’m Frank Stasio.
FRANK STASIO: Who decides the amount of food that will be produced in the United
States or the number of cars that will be manufactured? What determines the price of
shirts and watches and butter and beer? Well, you might be tempted to answer that it is
firms or individuals who produce those goods who decide on output and set the price.
But that answer is only half right. Consumers, the people who buy goods and services,
also play a big part. Producers and consumers, acting in their own self-interest, come
together to create the invisible marketplace where output is determined and prices are set.
Economists generally favor the market system as an efficient way to allocate a society’s
limited resources. Herbert Levine is a professor of economics at the University of
Pennsylvania.

HERBERT LEVINE: “In every economy there are many different types of decisions that
have to be made, and these decisions have to be coordinated into a meaningful set of
decisions about how resources are to be used so as to produce goods and services both
efficiently and in regard to people’s desires, and a market is a very effective mechanism
for coordinating those…all of those types of decisions.”
FRANK STASIO: The two groups who make up the market, as we’ve said, are
consumers and producers. Organizations that produce goods or services are called firms.
Most of the economy’s total output comes from the roughly fifteen million firms in the
United States.
HERBERT LEVINE: “When you look at the types of decisions that have to be made,
there are, basically, decisions that are made by people as consumers and as workers, and
decisions that are made by firms. The firms make the types of decisions that we refer to
as the ‘what’ decisions. That is, every economy has to decide what goods and services to
produce, how to produce them, and for whom they’re going to be produced. That is,
what is the distribution of the income, the output that’s produced by society. Firms make
the decisions what to produce, and they also make the decisions how to combine factors
of production: labor, capital...there’s machinery and land in making these goods.”
FRANK STASIO: To understand how firms make those decisions in a free economy, it
may be helpful to look at a system that does not permit the market to decide the price and
output, the so-called planned economy. Professor Levine is an expert on the economy of
the Soviet Union, which operates under a plan system.
HERBERT LEVINE: “In the United States, very simply, firms try to maximize their
monetary profit and that’s putting it an in an overly simple way, but for the purposes
here, let’s say that that’s the objective. In a Soviet-type economy, however, where
markets are not used as the main mechanism for generating and coordinating all of
these decisions, each firm is given a plan target, that it’s to produce not less than so

many and so many units of a very specified product, and that it’s to produce those
outputs not using more than so many and so many units of labor, so many units of
machine hours, so much land that it has to use, so much raw materials, etc.”
FRANK STASIO: The two systems lead to very different ways of determining what
gets produced and at what price.
HERBERT LEVINE: “In a market economy as I’ve been saying, the firm faces prices of
inputs, and it has a certain opportunity of altering the prices of its outputs, and so it
makes its decisions on what to produce and how to combine labor and machinery, etc., in
regard to these prices in such a way as to earn as high a profit as it can. What is the
analogue of this in a planned economy? Well, the manager of a Soviet firm has a set of
targets. At least so many of the different types of outputs that it might produce and no
more than so much labor, so much machinery, etc., in inputs. Furthermore, its objective,
at least we argue, its object…the manager’s objective is to earn a bonus, which are…the
bonuses are established by the Soviet regime in such a way that if you produce more than
your target, the manager earns a certain premium. Uh, you earn primarily for over-
fulfilling output targets rather than for cutting down on costs. As a result of this
managerial bonus system, managers in the Soviet, uh, you know, managers of firms in the
Soviet economy do try to produce high levels in terms of quantity of output.”
FRANK STASIO: The workings of the market system were first described in the book
The Wealth of Nations written by Adam Smith in 1776. Smith said the free market is
guided by an invisible hand which coordinates economic activity.
HERBERT LEVINE: “Now what is this independent…what is this invisible hand? It
really is the price system. If a firm finds that it is making a great deal of profit, then the
manager of that firm will increase the output of that good. You ask yourself, why is the
firm making a lot of profit? Well, what it means is, at the price established, people want

<!-- Page 5 -->

more of that good than was originally planned to be produced. By buying up a lot of that
product, people, representing their desires, communicate, without sending letters or
petitions to the owner of that firm--we want you to produce more. The fact that the
purchases lead to increased profit means that the manager of that firm will produce more.
Now, in trying to produce more, they’ll also raise the price somewhat. When he raises
the price, the people's demand, how much they’re willing to buy, gets reduced somewhat.
Also, as the firm tries to produce more, he tries to hire more labor. How does he hire
more labor? He has to offer higher prices for the labor. More laborers then try to get into
this activity. So this pursuit of profit which looks like a whole bunch of individual
atomistic types of decisions are really all coordinated through the interactions of people
responding, the prices of outputs, and prices of inputs.”
FRANK STASIO: So, in a market economy, price and output levels are set based on the
demand for a product and the cost of producing it. Demand is determined in large part by
the total number of consumers and their income. Then, of course, taste, values, and
cultural preferences come into play. Finally, demand for a given product will be
determined by its price. As the price of a product increases, demand drops off. If the
price falls, demand will increase. Experts are able to predict with reasonable accuracy
the demand for a product at each price level, but their calculations assume that prices of
other goods remain constant and that total income stays the same.
HERBERT LEVINE: “If you looked at what…what is the demand for, say, beef? You
would say, the demand for beef varies with the price of beef, but it also varies with many
other things. As you say, it will vary with the price of chicken. It will also vary with a
person’s income. It will also vary, perhaps, with a person’s age. What we do in our
demand analysis, we say, all right, given of all of these other factors, if they for the
moment remain constant, then the amount of beef that you buy will vary with the price of
beef. And then we say, however, okay, let us now vary the price of chicken. If the price
of chicken goes up, then, we say, people will be willing to buy more beef at every
possible price of beef. So, we say, it’s that the whole demand curve shifts outward.”

FRANK STASIO: So, demand is based to some extent on price while price depends
partly on demand. We’ve come full circle. Economists argue that it is precisely this
kind of circular activity throughout the economy that makes free markets efficient.
Without this constant feedback, the connection between what is needed and what is
produced breaks down.
HERBERT LEVINE: “Because what you have are managers trying to over-fulfill output
targets rather than respond to the desires of, not only the people as consumers, but even
those firms in the inter-industrial sector who use their output. For example, say a certain
manufacturer is to produce seven different types of machines and that other producers in
the economy need all those different types of machines. Well, what if the targets are set
for seven different types of machines, and the firm over-fulfills five of them and under-
fulfills two? Is the manager going to be denied a bonus? And the answer is, no. He’s
not denied a bonus. What tended to happen over time, then, is that the various
distributions of output, composition of output, got lumped into one number, number of
machines. As a result of this, Soviet manufacturers manufactured a great number of the
easiest machine to produce, and the classic argument made by Soviet economists
themselves when they criticized their own economy is the "nail factory." That is, let’s
say a firm is supposed to produce uh, a certain, uh, many different types of nails. Well,
how do you get one unit to represent this? They say, okay, this firm is supposed to
produce one hundred tons of nails this year. Well, the manager of that firm and the
cartoons in Soviet humor magazines show the firm producing one gigantic one-hundred-
ton nail as it rolls it out. That’s not very useful to the economy. But think about it for a
while. What if the target for that firm was numbers of nails rather than tons of nails?
Then, the manager would produce ten million one-quarter-inch nails for the economy,
and would fulfill and over-fulfill his target. So, the Soviets are stuck with a system that
does not differentiate in regard to the composition of output, the quality of output. The
focus is still the original focus, which was primarily just quantity of stuff.”

FRANK STASIO: Market economies also differ from planned economies in the way
firms decide how to produce their goods and services. Again, at the heart of a market
economy is the desire for greater profits, which requires firms to use the most efficient
production techniques. Levine says the drive for efficiency in a free market reflects the
instinct to survive.
HERBERT LEVINE: “In the competitive process, the pursuit of new methods of
producing things and new products to attract people’s attention is an extremely important
element in the pursuit of profit, and, therefore, the pursuit of high prizes, high profit, high
incomes, is this…is part of the drive that gives this dynamism to market economies, to
capitalist economies. However, there’s another element that’s extremely important that is
also handled differently in market economies, capitalist economies, and in planned
economies, and that is bankruptcy, or economic death. That is, let's say you’re an
industry…in a certain industry and your competitor develops a new method of producing
the good that both of you produce. This reduces his cost, which means he can reduce
his…his price, and still make a profit. Unless you also adopt that innovation, that new
way of producing things, you are going to die economically. The avoidance of death is in
my mind even more of a…of a drive of an incentive to innovate, to keep up with new
technology than is even the pursuit of large prizes.”
FRANK STASIO: Innovation is important, not only to the individual firm, but it also
fuels growth throughout the economy as a whole. In a market economy, consumers buy
the products they want at the price they’re willing to pay, providing firms with the
financial resources they need to meet consumer demand. Firms also buy resources from
consumers in the form of labor. This allows consumers to have enough money to buy the
goods and services that firms produce. This circular flow of money along with the
pressure to find ever more efficient production techniques encourages economic growth
in a market system. Levine explains that without these forces economic growth is more
difficult to achieve.

HERBERT LEVINE: “There are two aspects of growth. That is, you can produce more
of what you’re producing today, and you can produce it in the same way. Now, how can
that occur? Well, as long as you produce machines today, your capital stock continues to
grow, your population, as long as you have adequate health facilities and the birth rate is
high enough, the population will continue to grow. So, just through the mere increase in
inputs, and also by rearranging inputs– moving inputs from low productivity areas to
higher productivity areas–you can get growth without any technical change. However, as
an industrial economy matures, more and more of the growth comes from technical
progress rather than from just increasing labor and machinery inputs, and so the issue
then becomes: how do planners try to plan technical change? One way you can try to
plan technical change is by investing a lot in your scientific community, and the Soviets
have invested tremendously in their scientific community. But looking just at the
economic growth, essentially what you’re saying is, how do you plan for system change?
And that’s…that’s almost a contradiction in terms. Planning systems have their
strengths, whatever strengths they have, in stability, in developing routine. Technical
change is really the breaking of routine. The barriers to innovation that come from risk
avoidance, of Soviet managers, is probably the most important difficulty in the Soviet
economy today, well recognized by Soviet leaders.” In fact, Brezhnev, in the early
1970s, made a statement at a party congress that has been quoted very often by Soviet
economists, in which he said, ‘Why do our managers avoid technical change the same
way that the devil avoids holy water.’ ”
FRANK STASIO: While the market system gets high marks for efficiency, it is not
without its flaws. There are a number of social and economic problems that the free
market is not equipped to solve. There’s a joke about a distant planet reaching
temperatures of six hundred degrees on the bright side and four hundred fifty-six
degrees below zero on the dark side. Scientists decide it would be a fine place to live
since, on average, the temperature is seventy-two degrees.

HERBERT LEVINE: “One of the problems that developed in market economies that
showed up in the nineteenth century but intensified in the twentieth century, building up
to the Great Depression in the 1930s, was what we refer to as the macro-behavior of the
economy as contrasted to the micro-behavior. That is, while there is this coordination
mechanism going on among all of the micro-individual decisions in the economy, the
total macro-result, while being somewhat coordinated, may be coordinated at too low a
level of activity, which might mean that there is a high level of unemployment, or as
developed the level of coordination has a cyclical nature to it. Oh, at some points
demand and production are rising very high. They build up to a peak, and then the
demand starts falling off because of relationships between demand and supply, and we go
into a down part of the cycle. So this cyclical aspect of the macro-behavior of the
economy came to be a very detrimental aspect of the economy. Many people in the midst
of the Great Depression argued, ‘we have to sacrifice some of the efficiencies of the
market at the micro level to get rid of this terrible excesses of the cycle as they appeared,
and the great suffering that high levels of unemployment caused to people, and we have
to introduce planning.’ ”
FRANK STASIO: Also, the market makes no judgment about the fairness of income
distribution. By itself, the price system does little to help those in desperate poverty.
When it’s operating efficiently, the best a free market can do is offer equal opportunities
to all who have sufficient training, skill, or education, but there is no guarantee that the
market on its own will lead to an equitable income distribution. Once inequity exists,
there are mechanisms that are built into the price system that favor the well-endowed
over the poor.
HERBERT LEVINE: “When you look at the…the model of the market economy as I’ve
been describing it, all individuals seem to participate on an equal basis, but when you
look a little more closely, of course, people get to vote, in a sense, in the economy, in a
market economy, in relationship to how many dollars they have, because you vote with
your dollar. Either you buy a good or you don’t buy a good. Uh, it’s not that everybody

<!-- Page 10 -->

gets together once a week and votes, one-person, one-vote, in regard to what you want
produced. Therefore, there is an issue, a philosophical issue, a value issue. Uh, do you
accept, uh, the basis of how goods are to be produced and how they’re going to be
distributed to people with regard to… or that the decision-making mechanism there will
be the number of dollars that each one of us earns. In the economic sector, we usually
argue that, if you give each person one vote and distribute it equally… that is, if you have
a total egalitarian approach to income distribution, that you may get equal shares of the
pie, but that the pie is going to be very small. That, in regard to people’s psychological
reaction patterns, that if you reward people directly with regard to the effort that they put
forth, both effort at the workplace and effort in training themselves for the higher paying
jobs, that if you reward people more directly, and that means with some inequality and
income distribution, that you’ll get a larger pie.’
FRANK STASIO: There are some goods and services which the price system cannot
provide. These are called public goods.
HERBERT LEVINE: ‘The market economy covers all of those goods that are
produced by individual firms where you can have an established price on the product,
and, therefore, you can operate through the price-profit system. But take something
like uh, a lighthouse. A lighthouse is used by many, many different people, and yet
the product that it produce…produces is not diminished in any way if I use it. When
you get products of that nature, and it’s very vivid in the lighthouse example, you
can’t really charge directly for it. For those goods that we cannot charge directly for
individual use and also same goods, for those goods where the amount that somebody
purchases or uses does not diminish the availability to anybody else, we refer to those
as public goods, and a decision-making mechanism outside the market has to be, uh,
has to be constructed for that, and usually things like lighthouses, national defense are
handled by government directly through the governmental process.’

FRANK STASIO: Finally, the free market does not always capture all of the cost of
production, and may impose an unfair burden on society. These are the so-called
externalities of production.
HERBERT LEVINE: “A paper company located on a river, its costs are the cost of
labor, the cost of machinery, the cost of raw materials. It also has a waste problem as it
produces the paper. If you look only at the market, I am buying paper. We’ll only have
to pay for the direct costs of labor, machinery, and land. If the firm chooses to dump its
waste into the river, it’s a cost that I…I don’t have to pay for when I buy that paper. The
argument that individuals should not pay for, uh, the clearing up of pollution is to an
economist a fallacy. Not only should you, you must pay for it directly in the price of the
product because part of the production process of that automobile or of that ton of steel or
of that roll of paper, part of that cost is the social cost of preventing pollution. And the
point is that the market system itself has no real mechanism for attaching that cost, unless
the market…unless the firms are forced by government to prevent the pollution and then
to include those charges as part of the cost the car to the public, as part of the cost of
steel, as part of cost of the…the paper.”
FRANK STASIO: “For the most part, society is living under free market economies,
trying to resolve the shortcomings of the price system through the political process. They
have preferred to adjust the system, at times limiting market freedom rather than discard
the system altogether.

FRANK STASIO: Let’s review some of the main points in our discussion about the
market system. A market economy is made up of consumers who buy goods and
services, and firms which produce them. The demand for a product depends on the
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 12 -->

income and number of consumers as well as their tastes and preferences. Also, demand
is affected both by the price of the product and the price of other products that can be
used as substitutes. One of the forces that drives a market economy is profit
maximization. Firms in a market economy use the price system to allocate resources and
determine how and how much of a product will be produced. If the demand for a product
is greater than the supply, the price will rise, encouraging firms to turn out more. This
will draw more of an economy’s resources into the production of that good. Firms are
also encouraged by the price system to produce goods at the lowest possible costs.
Where the market system is not allowed to operate, decisions about price and output must
be centrally planned. Errors in judgment and the absence of incentives like profit, as well
as not having to fear bankruptcy, lead to inefficiency in planned economies. Also,
because there are few incentives for innovation, economic growth based on technological
change is difficult to achieve in a planned economy. Firms in a market system must
adapt to cost-saving changes in technology or risk losing profits and ultimately being
driven out of business. The price system does have its limitations, however. It is
possible for a market to achieve a balance between supply and demand at very low levels
of output, causing persistent high unemployment. The market system is blind to the issue
of income distribution and can result in great disparities in income between the rich and
poor. By itself, the market system will not provide public goods like national defense,
nor does it necessarily capture all of the costs in providing a product, the so-called
externalities of production. Most societies operating under free market economies have
recognized these shortcomings and have chosen to make adjustments to the system rather
than switch to a planned economy.
