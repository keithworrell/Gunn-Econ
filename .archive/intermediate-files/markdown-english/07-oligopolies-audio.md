FRANK STASIO: Commercials, the mark of fierce competition, one company after
another touting the praises of its products in breathless efforts to gain your business. But,
in fact, advertising is used many times to avoid competition. It’s true that firms work

hard to get your business but they’d rather not engage in head to head competition where
the consumer’s decision to buy is based on price alone. So, in the car industry for
instance manufacturers offer various packages of options and styles to make price
comparisons practically impossible. Think about how much easier the choice would be if
cars were like hamburger. Look in the paper for the grade that suited you and see which
dealer had the best price. There was time when the choice was almost that simple.
RICHARD STROUT: “They were lovely little cars. They were seven feet high and they
were as angular as uh, as an awning I would say, and uh, they would take you anywhere.”
FRANK STASIO: Richard Strout of the Christian Science Monitor is talking about the
Model T developed by Henry Ford. Durable and inexpensive, the Model T was a huge
success leaving the competition in the dust. It got you from here to there and working
people could afford it and that was enough to make most buyers ignore the no-frill styling
and a few minor inconveniences. Ford himself was convinced that cars sold on
performance not gadgets. Richard Strout.
RICHARD STROUT: “He said why should he go to the trouble of providing a
self-starter after all. And uh, why should he have uh, uh, a rear-view mirror in the car.
The joke was at the time, why have a rear mirror in a Ford car because whatever was
behind you would pass you soon anyway.”
FRANK STASIO: So, why aren’t we all driving updated versions of the Model T?
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “The reason we’re not driving Model T’s today is that’s
what people don’t want.”
FRANK STASIO: Doctor Thomas Kratinaker is a Law Professor at Georgetown
University. He said that businesses would prefer to differentiate their products in ways
other than price. In the early days of the auto industry, General Motors saw that it
couldn’t build a car like Ford and charge any less so it began to build different kinds of
cars and successfully convinced the American public that owning a GM car was a step up
in status.

THOMAS KRATINAKER: “Product differentiation is…it is a very important part of
competition. Sometimes it arises as a result of…of consumer confusion. That is,
consumers being misled into thinking that this product is really very different from that
product. Other times product differentiation is a phenomenon of adding frills that people
want.”
FRANK STASIO: By the 1960s, there were only four firms that made up the U.S. auto
Industry. Because there was so few competitors, that industry was said to be an
oligopoly. Firms in an oligopoly generally are able to take advantage of economies of
scale and by capturing a large share of the market they keep production costs down.
Such industries usually have heavy start-up costs that act as barriers of entry to new
companies. Businesses that make up an oligopoly diligently avoid price competition. In
the first place because there are so few other firms in the same field, it’s likely that each
competitor would cut its price to meet its rivals. So lowering the price just lowers the
profits for everybody else. Unless of course, the price cut is the result of a reduction in
costs. But even then, it’s usually just a matter of time before the competition acquires the
same cost advantage. As we’ve heard, companies try to differentiate their products from
their competitors to capture business without lowering prices. Advertising is the frontline
in the battle for product recognition and differentiation. There are other ways to avoid
lowering prices. Companies that willfully join to fix prices have formed an illegal
arrangement called a cartel.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “If the firms get together and explicitly agree on price
and…and divide up markets by say, having a monthly meeting in a hotel room in the
Adirondacks, that might be described as a cartel. All that is...is a…that’s quite simply a
monopoly in the sense that those people who are getting together are really acting as
though they all control all these firms together.”
JULIAN GRANGER: “Saturday night I was coming in on the late shift of the Knoxville
News Sentinel. I um, went to my box and I pulled all the…all the news releases and so
forth and there was the weekly or bi-weekly uh, news release of the uh, Tennessee Valley
### Authority.”

FRANK STASIO: One of the most celebrated cases of illegal price fixing was a scandal
in Nineteen Fifty-nine involving some of the major suppliers of the Tennessee Valley
Authority. Julian Granger was the reporter with the Knoxville News Sentinel who broke
the story.
JULIAN GRANGER: “And I got around to the second page and low and behold this uh,
thing jumped out on…at me. On this bidding, Allis Chalmers’s, General Electric, and
Pennsylvania Transformer quoted identical prices of a hundred and twelve thousand
seven hundred and twelve dollars.”
FRANK STASIO: Soon after the news broke, Congress announced that it would hold
hearings to investigate. Then the Justice Department launched a probe of its own and
built a case that eventually led executives of the big suppliers like General Electric,
Westinghouse, and Allis Chalmers to confess their part in the conspiracy.
ROBERT BICKS: “They used some names uh, registered under false names, called each
other uh, at home rather than at the office, uh, used unmarked envelopes.”
FRANK STASIO: Former Assistant Attorney General Robert Bicks who head the
Justice Department investigation.
ROBERT BICKS: “As identical bids became suspect, developed a rather com…complex
formula known colloquially as phase the moon whereby they overlaid detection. The
bids were just bad, uh, subject to a formula which enabled a rotating low bidder so that
everybody ended up with the agreed upon percentage of the business. The theory being
that detection would be …impossible.”
FRANK STASIO: TVA suppliers had formed a cartel. There was no doubt about the
purpose of their elaborate scheme. Each supplier would be guaranteed a fair share of the
market without dropping prices.
ROBERT BICKS: “I guess the upside was uh, raising the prices and what was thought to
be a comparatively easier, comfortable, more predictable life for the executives. You

really didn’t have to worry how much business you were gonna have at your end. You
agreed on that in January.”
FRANK STASIO: Firm price-fixing arrangements can be very difficult to prove if the
participants take pains not to document their agreements. Why don’t corporate
executives just divvy up the market while on a hunting trip or playing a round of golf.
No written records, no recording devices, and as long as nobody admitted their role, who
could prove collusion. Well, it turns out that the greatest obstacle to price-fixing is not
the government but the firms themselves. Law Professor Thomas Kratinaker.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “An oligopoly or cartel will be inherently unstable because
it’s in…well, its got an incentive to try to maximize profits. That incentive can cut either
way. On the one hand, they would like to get together and agree on price, engage in tacit
price coordination if they can’t get together without being caught by the FBI agents, but
on the other hand, they want a large market share, and once you have all gotten together
and raised price from say ten dollars to fifteen dollars and maybe you’re one of four
firms, you’re getting a quarter of that business, you’re gonna go home every night
thinking, gee, if I just drop price to thirteen fifty, I’d still be way above the competitive
price and I could get all of that business. And the second thought you’re gonna have is,
and my other three competitors just had the same thought before they went to bed last
night. So you’re constantly worried about whether your competitors are cheating and if
they’re not, why don’t you get out there and cheat.”
FRANK STASIO: Because price discipline is so hard to manage and because joining a
cartel is so risky, formal non-price competition usually takes another form. Firms in an
oligopoly often set prices through tacit coordination.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: “In…in that fashion what happens is you never get together
and discuss things on the phone. What you do is you read each other’s literature and you
learn to send signals by your behavior. Uh, you raise your price with the expectation that
the other guy will raise his price. Uh, if the other guy cuts his price, you immediately cut
your price to show him not to do that anymore.”

FRANK STASIO: This kind of unspoken agreement is perfectly legal. The industry
tacitly selects a price leader, then follows the behavior of that firm. Until the steel
industry fell prey to foreign competition, U.S. Steel was considered the price leader in
that business.
THOMAS KRATINAKER: Those people with long political memories, in any event,
will remember President Kennedy haranguing the president of U.S. Steel, when the steel
industry raised it prices, because President Kennedy knew that the steel…that the price
increase was due exclusively to the behavior of…of U.S. Steel. If you could get Steel’s
president to change it’s…his mind, then all the steel companies would roll their prices
back.”
FRANK STASIO: If it seems odd that a firm can be its own worst enemy in its drive to
reduce competition, it is perhaps more ironic that the government is often a cartel’s best
friend. While it is true that generally the government tries to break up concentrated
corporate power, there are times when the government sees an advantage in restricting
competition. Given the billions of dollars spent each year in the travel industry, you
wouldn’t think the airlines would need the government to help them make money. But
there was a time when air travel was a novelty more suited to adventurers than
vacationers. Clearly, commercial air travel would mean enormous benefits for the
economy. The government wanted to make sure that the United States was able to
develop a vigorous airline industry, so the airlines were regulated. The government
dictated fairs and routes leaving airline executives free of the uncertainties of
competition. Airlines were competing not on the basis of fairs, they were all the same.
Instead, they would promote their service, better meals, cheerier flight attendants,
convenient arrival times, movies, champagne and skies were never friendlier or more
expensive, but the cost of providing amenities didn’t matter. The airlines would simply
include them in their next fair increase request submitted to the Civil Aeronautics Board
which regulated the industry. So, service improved and fairs continued to climb. But for
travelers who could only afford the cost of getting from one place to another without the
extras, there was no service at all. Alfred Kahn was Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics
Board in the Carter Administration.

ALFRED KAHN: “Fundamentally, economic regulation in airlines as in trucking and
communications and many other fields was a comprehensive scheme for the suppression
of competition. In all its forty-year history, the Civil Aeronautics Board had not
permitted a single new carrier to come in. They prevented new competitive entry. They
were keeping the Freddie Lakers of the world out. They prevented price competition.
That may have served some purpose when it was first set up in the ‘30s, and they thought
that this was an infant industry and you needed protection in order to develop reliable
continuous service. But by the ‘60s and ‘70s it was clear that it had all the evils of
monopoly and cartelization and protection, and in a world of stagflation of wage-price
spirals of inadequate productivity, it was clear to almost all disinterested observers that
we wanted the benefits of competition and that meant deregulation.”
FRANK STASIO: Kahn and many others by the mid-1970s believed the time had come
to end regulation in the airline industry. As in the decision to end Bell Telephone’s
monopoly on long-distance service, the government felt that the public interest was no
longer served by restricting competition. In 1978 the airline industry was de-regulated
and airline executives who once hovered high above the competitive fray now found
themselves in the trenches slugging it out for a piece of the action.
ALFRED KAHN: “De-regulation has done almost all the things we said it was gonna do.
Competition is obviously intensified and that’s what we wanted it to do. You have more
carriers in individual markets and they’re competing with one another. Um, as a result of
that uh, prices are much…with some exceptions, which you know and I know uh, prices
on average are much better attuned to costs, which is what competition does. That means
they’ve gone down on the long routes. They’ve gone down on the dense routes where
you have the advantages you can use big planes and pack them full. They’ve gone down
on vacation routes. Uh, they’ve gone down on off peak much more than on-peak, partly
because…mainly because you have many more discount seats available off peak than
on-peak. All that, I could go on at length, is economically desirable. The result is that
passengers have a much wider range of choices. You go in uh, to People Express where
the seats are narrower. They’ve taken out all those seats. They put many more seats in

planes, much less leg-room, you carry your own baggage, you bring a sandwich, and you
can fly places for nineteen dollars that used to cost you ninety-nine dollars.”
FRANK STASIO: Alfred Kahn’s glowing assessment of the effective de-regulation
comes from the point of view of a consumer. For the airlines, it was a much different
story. Airline executives would be forced to learn a whole new style of management.
The smaller leaner airlines which were already in the habit of cost conscious management
marched ahead steadily in the transition from regulation to competition, while the big
national carriers stumbled, and in some cases fell.
HOWARD PUTNAM: “With all of our financial difficulties, we couldn’t generate the
revenue. And with all the innovations that we tried, we just couldn’t get enough revenue
and cash from the till.”
NEWS REPORTER: “Braniff’s passengers were just as surprised as Braniff’s
employees. Hundreds of them have been stranded. In some cases flights already in the
air were told to turn around and come back.”
FRANK STASIO: Proponents of de-regulation had argued for a long time that some
carriers would have gone out of business if it wasn’t for the government, that the
government was, in effect, subsidizing their inefficiency. The collapse of Braniff shortly
after de-regulation seemed to prove their point. Braniff Chairman, Howard Putnam.
HOWARD PUTNAM: “Well, I think under de-regulation uh, it was probably inevitable,
although no one wanted to admit it that somebody’s gonna fail. In the free enterprise
system if you believe in it and I do, the strong and the well-managed are gonna succeed.
The weak and the poorly managed probably are gonna fail and probably ought to. So no
one knew who it was going to be. Uh, de-regulation did not cause the demise of Braniff.
I still believe in de-regulation. De-regulation simply gave the management of Braniff at
that time the opportunity to expand it. They gave them the opportunity to succeed and
the opportunity to fail.”
FRANK STASIO: The airlines were not the only ones squeezed in the transition. Small
towns and sparsely populated regions which had never been profitable markets for the

large carriers now found themselves cut off. Albert Rosenthal, the Mayor of Meridian,
Mississippi.
ALBERT ROSENTHAL: “You’d have to promise me that if we would upgrade our
main runway to accommodate their 727s, they were gonna sell their DC-9s and we’d
have 727 service non-stop from Atlanta to Dallas ninety days after de-regulation took
effect. Delta advised us that under de-regulation essential air service they were gonna
leave Meridian. We’d spent five million dollars. I told Senator Stennis I felt it would be
a disaster to our part of the country, that we were the economic poorest in the country and
we were beginning to grow, but economics required transportation as well as a workforce
and an education for the workforce, and that without airline transportation, we would
have it even more difficult to overcome our economic drawbacks.”
FRANK STASIO: Towns like Meridian, Mississippi may be heard in the short run, but
in many cases when larger carriers pulled out, small commuter airlines took their place.
Their scaled down operations made it possible to offer air service to local travelers and
still make money. Again, this seems to bear out the predictions made by de-regulation
proponents that without the government the airline industry would seek its own level of
efficiency and profitability, and that in the end the consumer is the winner when the
marketplace and not the government or business sets the price for a product. We have
heard the ways that businesses try to control the market in industries made up of only a
few firms. But what about companies with lots of competitors? Have the developed
ways to avoid price competition? To find the answer, we talked to Nariman Behravesh, a
Vice President for Wharton Econometrics. Nariman, is there any way that smaller firms
who face more competition than automakers or steel makers can have any real influence
on their markets?
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: “The one way that firms can control the market is by selling
a product that’s slightly different from other products. This is called monopolistic
competition, and in effect, it’s a weak kind of monopoly. Weak in the sense that the
product is only slightly different and there are other substitutes, but monopoly in the
sense that it is different enough so that the producer really is facing the market himself or

herself. And so from that point of view these kinds of firms like, let’s say the designer
jean manufacturers or the toothpaste manufacturers or detergent manufacturers can, in
fact, create something of a monopoly situation.”
FRANK STASIO: Now I noticed in those examples you were talking about industries
where there are many competitors unlike say the car industry or the steel industry. Is the
one of the characteristics of monopolistic competition?
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: “That’s exactly right in the sense that a monopolistic
competition is characterized by a lot of different producers and, in fact, it could be the
four or five gas stations around a neighborhood could be monopolistic competitors.”
FRANK STASIO: Can they get together in any way to control the output of their
product?
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: “Typically they don’t because the way they try to control
the market is through product differentiation rather than through any kind of collusion.
Uh, in fact, what they do is they try to define their product in such a way that it is as…as
monopolistic as possible and then what they try to do is limit the output to the extent that
they can to maximize their profits.”
FRANK STASIO: Well, Nariman, what are the limits then for firms in monopolistic
competition in controlling their market?
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: “The limits uh, to how much a monopolistic competitor can
control output and raise prices are dictated by the availability of substitutes. Uh, this
brings in a term that we refer to as cross price elasticity. If that’s fairly high for a
product, in other words, there are available substitutes, then the firm in question doesn’t
have too much power to limit output and raise prices, because people would quickly
switch into other products. If that cross price elasticity is low, then the firm has
somewhat more leeway to limit its output and raise prices.”

<!-- Page 12 -->

FRANK STASIO: So we have monopoly, oligopoly, and we have monopolistic
competition. Let’s compare and contrast those in terms of their control over the market,
their control of output and the kinds of prices they can command?
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: “Well, it’s useful to look at these examples in a kind of
spectrum where on the one hand you have perfect competition and at the other extreme
you have monopoly and somewhere in between you have a monopolistic competition and
oligopoly. A monopolistic competition is probably the closest to perfect competition. In
those markets prices are maybe a little bit higher than perfectly competitive markets and
output is just a little bit lower. Moving up the scale a little bit, you go to oligopoly where
prices are a little bit higher and output is a little bit lower, and then finally you get to
monopoly where, in fact, prices are much higher and outputs quite a bit lower than the
perfectly competitive case.
FRANK STASIO: Now a review of the main points in our discussion of oligopoly. An
oligopoly is an industry made up of very few competitors. Firms in an oligopoly avoid
price competition because of the likelihood that their competitors will drop their prices as
soon as one firm lowers its price. The result would be lower profits for all the
companies. These firms avoid price competition by product differentiation. That is,
distinguishing their product from that of a competitor in ways that make price
comparisons difficult. This is usually done through advertising. Businesses in an
oligopoly may also form an illegal relationship called a cartel in which executives in each
of the firms explicitly agree on what prices to charge and how much of the market each
will control. Cartels are difficult to form and maintain not only because they’re illegal
but also because individual firms within a cartel often yield to the temptation to break
with the group and reap higher profits on their own. There is a less formal arrangement
in which companies tacitly agree to follow the direction of a price leader. Because there
is no explicit collusion among the corporate executives, this practice is no illegal.
Sometimes it is the government and not the companies in an industry that creates an
oligopoly. The government may choose to regulate an industry like the airline business
to foster its growth in the early stages. When it’s apparent that government assistance is
no longer necessary, the government may move to end regulation. De-regulation of the

airline industry showed how an oligopoly can keep prices artificially high, but while
forcing airlines to face direct competition may have lowered some fairs, it also reduced
service for some less profitable markets. Still, the government’s position in general has
been to let the marketplace decide how goods and services should be allocated unless
there is greater public benefit in regulating the industry. Industry is where the relatively
large number of competitors who are able to distinguish their products from a rivals are
said to practice monopolistic competition. This is a weak form of monopoly in which
product differentiation is the main tool in avoiding price competition. Product
differentiation is usually achieved through advertising. The control over prices by a firm
in monopolistic competition is limited, however, by the degree to which consumers are
likely to switch to slightly different product made by a competitor. The measure of
consumer’s willingness and ability to switch from one product to another is called cross
price elasticity. American industry has faced varying degrees of competition from
perfect competition in which the producer has no control over price to the progressively
less competitive markets of monopolistic competition in oligopoly. And finally,
industries where there is no competition called monopolies.
