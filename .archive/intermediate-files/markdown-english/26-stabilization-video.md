DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In 1981, the Federal Reserve set out to quell inflation once
and for all. A year later, 12 million workers were unemployed. Why was it so hard to
break the back of inflation? In 1985, the leaders of the industrial world gathered in Bonn
to wrestle with the question, “Why was a growing international trade making it harder to
solve domestic economic problems?” In 2008, why would Treasury Secretary Paulson
and Fed Chairman Bernanke ask Congress for a $700 billion bailout for a banking system
that had failed the American people?
The activists’ theories of fiscal and monetary policy have dominated modern economics
since the Great Depression. But by 2011 we were having some doubts. Stabilization
Policy: Are We Still in Control? That’s the story we’ll investigate, with the help of
Economic Analysts Nariman Behravesh and Richard Gill, on this 21st- Century Edition of
Economics U$A. I’m David Schoumacher.

# Part I

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: For many years after the Great Depression, the basic goal of
national economic policy was to minimize unemployment. But the winter of 1982 saw
12 million men and women unemployed, and many complained bitterly that they were
the victims of a needlessly cruel government policy. This time public enemy number one
was inflation and the jobless workers were the casualties in the war. The severity of the
battle cast new doubt on the ability of the government to effectively manage the
economy…or the wisdom of even trying. Why was it so hard to break the back of
inflation?
RICHARD M. NIXON: “The time has come for decisive action…action that will break
the vicious circle of spiraling prices and costs.”
### GERALD FORD: “Inflation is domestic enemy number one…”

JIMMY CARTER: “Present high inflation threatens the economic security of our
nation.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: From Richard Nixon through Jimmy Carter, president after
president set out to fight inflation. But when that fight threatened to increase
unemployment, president after president reversed course, opting for stimulative policies
to keep the economy growing and unemployment low.
GERALD FORD: “We must shift our emphasis from inflation to recession.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: For more than a decade the economy grew a little and
prices grew a lot. American ended 1979 with significantly higher inflation than we had
in 1970. By the end of the decade most Americans expected inflation to be with them
forever…and they conducted themselves accordingly. Fred Schultz was Vice Chairman
of the Federal Reserve in 1979…

FRED SCHULTZ: “When you have inflation, money becomes worth less and the
financial assets of bonds and stocks don’t respond as well…and the thing you need to do
is to go out and buy things. You need to buy art and stamps and gold and land and
houses...and… So people got in the habit of going out and borrowing all they could
borrow and spending all they could spend. And it takes a long time to change the way
people carry out their activities. In the 1970s, people were convinced we were going to
get inflation under control, and only in the latter part of the 1970s…in ‘78 and ’79…did
they become convinced that we weren’t going to get it under control. And so, then, that’s
when inflation really began to heat up very rapidly.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In the closing months of 1979, Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker, announced a new tight money policy to counter inflation. He was forced to
abandon this policy in the recession of 1980…But 1981 brought a new president and a
renewed determination to clamp down on inflation. But the Reagan administration
wanted it all…both lower inflation and higher growth. The Fed sent out warning signals.
FRED SCHULTZ: “We kept saying, all through the early part of 1981, that if there’s too
big a tax cut…or if it is not matched by expenditure cuts…that’s going to make the
monetary policy more difficult, because, if you’re putting fiscal thrust into the economic
system, and you are trying to restrain it with monetary policy, that means that interest
rates are going to be higher than they otherwise would have been. And we made speech
after speech…We had meeting after meeting in which we said, ‘If this tax cut’s too big or
if their expenditure cuts are not big enough, interest rates are going to go very high’…and
they did.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: When the Federal Reserve began once again to tighten the
money supply, workers and businessmen alike refused to believe that the government
was serious about ending inflation. Wages and prices continued upwards, growing faster
than the money supply. The economy was out of balance…It was bound to topple…and
it did. Late in 1981, the economy headed into a recession and millions of Americans

<!-- Page 5 -->

headed for the unemployment line. But even as the unemployment line grew, workers
continued to ask for increases to pay for the inflation that had become part of their lives.
The Fed stuck to its guns…By the spring of 1982 things were bad throughout
America…By the summer, they were worse. Fred Schultz was given the lonely job of
explaining why the Fed was causing so much pain.
FRED SCHULTZ: “But I’ll never forget…That...I...The worst thing that happened to me
the whole time I was on the Fed Board was…I made a speech and tried to explain…and
this was to a group of automobile dealers…and one of them stood up and said, ‘I
understand what you’re trying to do, Mr. Vice Chairman, but I want you to know I’ve
tried for more than 30 years to build up a successful automobile dealership and next week
I’m going to close my doors’…And I’ll tell you, that kind of thing stays with you for a
long time. It was very hard on us, you know, to try to be in that kind of a position where
you know you’re causing individual pain…It’s not something that’s just theoretical…
You know you’re hurting people out there…and to know it’s something you have to do is
tough when you’re doing it, but I think the results have shown now that it was successful.
The country is back on a much sounder path.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: As the summer wore on, and unemployment passed 10
percent, the inflation rate began to drop. In August, Volcker announced that the time had
come to ease monetary policy. Wall Street was the first to respond. But the bitter
memories of the recession lingered on…and faith in counter-cyclical policy was one of
the casualties. Many people blamed the misery on the failures of stabilization policies in
the 1970s. Others, like Congressman Henry Reuss, blamed the unnecessarily harsh
policies of the 1980s.
HENRY REUSS: “Now I’m all for curing inflation…but, in my view, it could have been
done without stepping on the brake so hard that the economy was thrown through the
windshield.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: By Christmas, the economy was growing again. Workers
began returning to their jobs and inflation held at four percent throughout 1983. By
1985, after two years of recovery, inflation remained at four percent...but the economy
still bore the scars of the recession. Millions of manufacturing jobs were gone for
good…and unemployment remained stuck at seven percent. Fifteen years of entrenched
inflationary expectations had been sharply reduced, but only after the government had
finally proven its willingness to pay the price necessary to wring inflation out of the
economic system. We asked economic analyst Richard Gill why a tight monetary policy
had caused such hardship.
## (Music Plays - Comment And Analysis I)

(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: If one takes a benign view, one could argue that the difficult times of
the early 1980s were really a reflection of the success of our past policies. Keynesian
economics was directed mainly at stabilizing the growth of real national income and, if
you compare recent decades with the decades before World War II, you find that the
American economy did pretty well. Here is the way the growth of our real GNP
fluctuated before World War II. And this is what happened from the 1950s to 1980. In
real terms, the economy was much more stable in the recent period. The very success of
these policies, however, undoubtedly contributed to the recent inflationary tendencies of
the economy and, perhaps more significantly, to the expectation of future inflation. By
1980, they had created a general sense that the government would back down in the
inflation fight as soon as it began to create serious costs in terms of recession and
unemployment. People, in short, began betting on continued inflation. And this made the
government’s task infinitely more difficult. The government had to act strongly enough
to break the back of these well-entrenched inflationary expectations. It not only had to
fight inflation, but to fight a general belief that it would not fight inflation that hard.
Expectations are important in economics. They made the task of monetary policy much
harder in the early 1980s. Some economists, indeed, have come to the conclusion that
they make stabilization policy virtually useless in general. According to this new

school…the so-called “rational expectationists”…only unexpected government policies
are likely to have any effect on the economy, and these unexpected policies will more
than likely be harmful. So far have we come from the happy days of the Keynesian
revolution!
# Part Ii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In 1983, America came bouncing out of the recession with
a boisterous recovery. But a funny thing happened on the way to prosperity. Out of all
those billions of dollars of consumer spending, too much seemed to be pouring overseas.
At the same time, foreigners had a high percentage of our national debt. By 1985,
economists both here and abroad were asking, “Is our domestic economy the hostage of
international forces?” Those international forces had been building throughout the 1970s.
During that decade, the percentage of our economy devoted to foreign trade doubled,
passing 10 percent by 1981. What problems would this create for the conduct of
economic policy? We asked economist Robert Gordon…
ROBERT GORDON: “The problems that that creates would be no problem at all if it
were not for the flexible variable exchange rate of the dollar…Which means that
conducting policy in Washington now has side effects that didn’t used to exist…Namely,
if we decide to fight inflation with tight money and loose or easy fiscal policy…the
policies of the 1980s…then we’re going to find that part of our economy is harmed while
another part benefits. And we are really taking from Peter to pay Paul.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: 1983 was a year of vigorous growth for America. As the
economic recovery surged ahead it soon became obvious that many Americans were
being left behind. While millions of jobs were being created in the service industries,
millions more in manufacturing appeared gone for good…lost to overseas competition.
RAY CALORE: “Well, there’s no question about it. We’re in deep trouble…and
specifically…right here in Tarrytown where about 2,000 people will be laid off…they’re

<!-- Page 8 -->

in deep trouble. I don’t know any place in the state of New York where there’s anybody
gonna hire 2,000 people.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In the ‘60s and ‘70s, expansive economic policies had
created jobs for American workers. Now these same policies were creating jobs overseas
while Americans remained unemployed. The situation was causing severe problems for
American policymakers, as Federal Reserve Governor Henry Wallich explains…
HENRY WALLICH: “You may want to expand the economy…let us say by budget
deficit or easier money…but some of this demand goes abroad. People buy Japanese cars
and so you get expansion in Japan but not in Detroit. For instance, we’ve got a 200-odd
billion dollar budget deficit, but half of the money is going abroad and so we’re getting
stimulation only from half. Fiscal policy is losing much of its power.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: No one in the Reagan administration had foreseen this
effect in 1981 when the administration first embarked on its expansive course…But as
our trade deficit shot past the $100 billion mark, economists and politicians alike began
to search for a solution. Most economists agreed that the trade deficit was caused by the
overly strong American dollar, which was in turn caused by the runaway budget deficit.
But many politicians began to argue for trade barriers to keep out the flood of imports.
The Reagan administration resisted this approach.
BERYL SPRINKEL: “All economists…I’d say 99.9 percent of economists...believe that
we all gain from free trade. This administration believes we gain from free trade…And
therefore, we are not going to lead the world down a protectionist road which will reduce
our standard of living and reduce standards of living abroad.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In May of 1985, the heads of state of the leading industrial
nations of the free world met in an economic summit conference in Bonn, West
Germany, to try to resolve differences in economic policy. The Europeans and the
Japanese urged the U.S. to get its budget deficit under control. We urged them to expand

<!-- Page 9 -->

their economies to create new markets for American goods. No firm decisions were
made, but international cooperation remains a promising approach to economic problems.
### Beryl Sprinkel speaks for the Reagan administration…

BERYL SPRINKEL: “When governments recognize a particular set of policies are in
their interest, they are very likely to move in that direction. The great difficulty is trying
to get them to do something which they perceive is against their interest. And they won’t
do it. They shouldn’t do it. And we won’t do it either. But I think that working together
you can make some progress on the economic front and, in fact, I think we have done so
over the past give years.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Five months after the Bonn summit, the U.S., Japan,
France, Britain and Germany announced a coordinated effort to reduce the value of the
U.S. dollar. The move was a promising effort to ease the U.S. international trade
dilemma and possibly create more jobs for American workers. But major problems
remained.
By 1985, the United States was running $200 billion budget deficits. But half the
economic stimulus, the amount of the U.S. trade deficit, was going overseas and any
effort to contain this deficit or to promote continued growth would have a major impact
around the world. We asked economist Richard Gill why the international aspect was
much more important in U.S. policy.
## (Music Plays - Comment And Analysis Ii)

(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: The main reason the international aspect is so important today is that
the numbers have gotten so big. We had our first post-war merchandise deficit in 1971:
A little over two billion dollars. By 1984, our merchandise deficit was over 105 billion
dollars. And what these numbers mean is that we can’t separate our domestic
stabilization policies from our international trade policies. To take a simple example: It

<!-- Page 10 -->

has been argued that our trade deficit in 1984 was mainly due to an overvalued dollar.
This made our exports too expensive and foreign imports too cheap. Well, the value of
the dollar is determined by supply and demand. Thus, the high value of the dollar must
have been due to a great demand for dollars…largely for investment in the U.S….in
relation to supply. Simple solution: Increase the supply of dollars. Have the Fed start
printing money and buying back those billions of dollars of U.S. Treasury securities held
by foreigners. But wait a second! Hadn’t we just gone through a very painful period of
monetary restraint to break the back of our inflation? If the Fed began printing up money
like that, what would happen to those dread “inflationary expectations” we had been at
such pains to destroy? The simple fact is that, in an interdependent world economy, we
have many more variables to take into account. And this creates still another difficulty
for our already rather shaky efforts at economic stabilization.
# Part Iii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In the prosperous 1990s the Fed’s fine tuning of the
economy seemed to work. But the collapse of the housing market in 2007 revealed a
major flaw in our financial system and in our regulatory agencies as well. Once again,
the government was forced to intervene. Would its actions stabilize the economy?
Early in 2007, the housing bubble began to burst. Cheap mortgages, low down payments,
and confidence that purchasing a home was a solid investment led Americans to buy
expensive properties...properties well beyond their means. Banks loaned and resold loans
to investors in the market. It seemed so easy. Everyone was making money. It seemed
too good to last. And it didn’t. The housing market collapsed, leaving the banks holding
the bag. One by one the big banks, investment houses, and insurance companies began to
fail and with them went the open door to credit, the lifeblood of the economy.
In September of 2008, with the banking industry on the verge of collapse, Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke nervously came
before Congress to tell them the sky was falling.

<!-- Page 11 -->

BENJAMIN BERNANKE: “I believe if the credit markets are not functioning, that jobs
will be lost, the unemployment rate will rise, more houses will be foreclosed upon, GDP
will contract…that the economy will just not be able to recover in a normal, healthy way
no matter what other policies are taken.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: They had an unorthodox plan. Bernanke and Paulson were
asking for Congress to release taxpayer money so that that they could then infuse that
money into a faltering financial industry.
HENRY PAULSON: “This Troubled Asset Purchase program, on its own, is the single
most effective thing we can do to help homeowners, the American people, and to
stimulate the economy.”
DOUGLAS ELLIOT: “The government was at a point where it had to do something, and
so it came up with a program that came to be called the Troubled Asset Relief Program,
the TARP. It’s kind of a misnomer, because the way it was really used in the end was as
a way of injecting capital into banks, basically investing in the banks and some insurance
companies so that they had enough equity that people knew that they could make it
through the crisis. So the government became a partner with the banks and the insurance
companies. It was hugely important, it was absolutely necessary. But the public to this
day hates it and thinks that it was a mistake.”
WOMAN: “My resentment is towards the fat cats on Wall Street who are probably going
to ride off into the sunset with millions in their saddle bags while the rest of us are
worried about our 401K s.”
MAN: “That’s my concern, is that I’m going to shoulder responsibility for a lot of
problems that I didn’t create.”
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 12 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Even before TARP could be enacted and capital could flow
into the financial system, it was labeled a bailout by both political opponents and a
majority of the public. Americans were looking to point the blame. And along with the
so-called “fat cats on Wall Street,” people began questioning the institution that should
have been minding the store--the Federal Reserve.
KAREN PETROU: “The Fed, as the Senior Regulator for the biggest financial
institutions, failed miserably. You can see that into the fall of 2008, where in October,
November, at the Fed, and the OCC, which is the big regulator, the regulator of big
national banks, thought Citibank was so sound that it could have taken over one of the
weakest banks. Only they had no idea that Citi had $300 plus billion of off balance sheet
liabilities on its books.”
DIMITRI PAPADIMITRIOU: “The Fed has said that it’s very difficult to know when
there is an asset bubble. Unfortunately, you only know when the bubble bursts.
However, the conditions were actually very obvious. You have seen that an inflationary
housing market cannot continue forever…and therefore there were steps the Fed could
have taken.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Since the Fed did not take the lead and raise interest rates, it
allowed risky lending practices to continue at a feverish pace.
DONALD KOHN: “We were tightening in 2005, 2006, but should we have tightened
more in order to take the steam out of the housing market and to prevent the subsequent
disaster? My view is that we kept our eyes on the right thing, that if you give monetary
policy too many jobs--employment prices and asset prices--then you don’t get any of
them quite right.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: With TARP, however, many economists believe the
government could redeem itself by thinking outside the box.

<!-- Page 13 -->

GEORGE W. BUSH: “America’s economy is facing unprecedented challenges and we
are responding with unprecedented action.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: If Congress would pass TARP, then the government, rather
than acting as lender of last resort, would become an investor.
BENJAMIN BERNANKE: “Going forward, the ability of the Treasury to use the TARP
to inject capital into financial institutions, and to take other steps to stabilize the financial
system, including any actions that might be needed to prevent the disorderly failure of a
systemically important financial institution, will be critical to restoring confidence and
promoting the return of credit markets to more normal functioning.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: On October 3, 2008 TARP was signed into law.
DOUGLAS ELLIOT: “This was a good program. I’ve described it as the best large
federal program ever to be despised by the public. If you ask the person on the street
they will tell you, if they follow this at all, that the tax payers spent $700 billion, got back
almost nothing, and that most of it went into the pockets of the bankers. All of those
statements are false. The government did not invest $700 billion; in fact, it was
significantly less than that in the end. The investments will actually have made tax
payers money.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: TARP was successful at ending the threat of a complete
banking catastrophe. By 2010, most of the banks had paid back the money, and the cost
of the program was far less than expected.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But confidence did not return and the economy did not
stabilize as many hoped it would. Markets continued to drop, jobs continued to vanish,
and banks, though they had billions in taxpayer dollars, were reluctant to begin lending
again, and the doors of credit barely remained open. As a result, though TARP saved the
financial industry from collapse, the benefits of the program failed to reach those it was
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 14 -->

truly intended to help--the American people. So why didn’t the government go one step
further and mandate the conditions on how those TARP funds were to be used? We
asked that question of economic analyst Nariman Behravesh.
## (Music Plays - Comment And Analysis Iii)

(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: To some people TARP -- the Troubled Asset Relief
Program, was and still is a four-letter word. To these people it represented all that is
wrong with our financial system—especially the part about taxpayer money being used to
bailout Wall Street “fat cats.”
There are several myths about the TARP. One is that the program cost U.S. taxpayers
$700 billion. In fact, it cost a tiny fraction of that amount, since the recipients of the
funds paid most of it back—and the government may have actually made a profit on the
program. Another myth is that the “fat cats” got the money. They did not. The funds
were disbursed as temporary loans, almost all of which were returned.
In the end, the TARP was an emergency program that along with the unorthodox and
massive monetary stimulus provided by the Fed—prevented the implosion of the U.S.
financial system and economy. Without it, chances are good that things would have been
a lot worse for the economy and the American people.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Can we control the economy? Well, for many years we
were convinced that we could. However, economists are no longer so certain. The
problems of runaway deficits, the effective expectations on people’s behavior, and the
increasing interdependence of the world’s economies have forced economists and
policymakers to face increasingly difficult and complex decisions. Fortunately the huge
engine of the American economy continues to be a powerful force throughout the
world…and prudence demands that we provide this engine with some form of guidance.
