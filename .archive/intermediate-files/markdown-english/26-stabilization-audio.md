FRANK STASIO: Economics U$A. One of a series of programs designed to explore
twentieth- century micro and macroeconomic principles. The subject of this edition is
Stabilization Policy. Our guest is Phillip Cagan, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University, and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. I’m Frank Stasio.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: “We know increased taxes are not needed to enable us to
balance the federal budget and to begin very soon a rapid reduction in the national debt.
Why? Because, recovery is with us. Federal revenues are increasing.”
JOHN F. KENNEDY: “Every dollar saved from taxation that is spent or invested will
help create a new job and a new salary. And these new jobs and new salaries can create
other jobs and other salaries. And more customers available.”
GERALD FORD: “There are serious setbacks in sales and unemployment. Therefore,
we must shift our emphasis, from inflation, to recession.”

MALE VOICE: “Restraint on the money supply. Reducing its growth over time toward
levels consistent with price stability.”
FRANK STASIO: Since the Great Depression, economists and policymakers have
sought ways to predict and avoid sharp swings in economic activity. During the ‘40s,
deficit spending was crucial to America’s recovery from the Depression. Though the
deficits of that time were due to the war and not a conscious policy, the effect of the
deficits in pulling the country out of stagnation converted many skeptical economists to
the doctrine of economic activism. But there is still much debate over when and how the
government should intervene. Economists disagree over what forces are most important
in driving economic activity. The Monetarist view stresses the importance of the money
supply in influencing the business cycle. If the economy is in balance and the growth of
the money supply starts to slow, the country heads toward a recession. If the money
supply grows rapidly, from the point of equilibrium, there tends to be inflation. So, for
example, the severity of the Depression in the 1930s, for a Monetarist’s point of view,
was caused by a sudden sharp contraction in the money supply. Phillip Cagan is a
professor of economics at Columbia University, and visiting scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute.
PHILIP CAGAN: “In the famous study by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, A
Monetary History of the United States, that is their prime example, you might say, of…
of their empirical support, from a Monetarist point of view, that the Depression of the
1930s was primarily a monetary phenomenon. From 1929 to ‘33, the money supply was
allowed to contract by 25 percent. So, in their view, it made what was…would have
been…an ordinary recession into a major disaster. Following 1933, the money supply
started expanding very rapidly, and, for the next four years, the rate of growth of nominal
income in the economy was the fastest for any four-year period in our history. The
trouble is, is that we started from such a low level that, even after four years, we still had
a considerable amount of unemployment. Then, in 1937, the money supply again was
allowed to contract very sharply, so that the recovery that was going on from the 1929,
‘33 contraction was, then, interrupted in 1937, ‘38 for a second severe contraction in
economic activity in a row, so that, with that, in 1938, ’39 and ‘40, we were still at a very

low level. So, that even though the 1930s is a period of considerable change, up and
down, we tend to look upon at it as just one vast wasteland because unemployment was
large, and never…never really got down low enough. But it was a period of change, and
was, in their view, one that is almost completely explained in terms of these– terms of its
economic disaster– almost completely explained by what was an inadequate monetary
policy and…and disastrous contractions in the money supply.”
FRANK STASIO: Keynesian economists feel that the severity of the Depression was not
due to monetary forces, but, rather, a breakdown in the market mechanism. The
automatic adjustments, which earlier economists believed would offset a decline in
spending, failed to materialize. Now, Keynesian economists don’t deny that the money
supply fell during the Depression. The question that divides economists is, which came
first. Which is the cause, and which is the effect? Trying to solve this riddle is no idle
exercise. Whether you believe the money supply drives demand or demand drives the
money supply will have a noticeable effect on the remedies you prescribe.
PHILIP CAGAN: ‘Well, an early Keynesian view didn’t put much emphasis on money
at all, but a much more recent Keynesian view would be consistent with the idea that
monetary policy should have… take discretionary steps to offset what is happening in the
economy because it’s subject to a lot of ups and downs that are generally unpredictable.
Whereas a Monetarist view has been that, if you had a fairly stable rate of growth in the
money supply, this would take away most of the sources of changes in the economy, in
aggregate demand. And that the remaining ones would not be too serious, but, in
addition, that there wouldn’t be much that you could do about these anyway through
monetary policy. So, that the best…best thing that the monetary authorities could do
would be to follow a stable monetary growth policy.’
FRANK STASIO: One of the major disagreements between Keynesians and Monetarists
is the question of whether a free market economy, left to itself can automatically correct
swings in the business cycle. Phillip Cagan points out that the Keynesians have less faith
than Monetarists in the market’s ability to automatically stabilize the economy when it
has reached high levels of unemployment.

PHILIP CAGAN: ‘The Monetarist view would be that there can be shocks that will
occur… that, to aggregate demand, and that these shocks will tend to cause changes in
aggregate spending, but that the economy can quickly adjust to these by changes in the
price level or wage level, so that we remain more or less at a full-employment level.
Whereas the Keynesian system has certainly pointed out that, in many cases, prices and
wages are sticky, so that the shocks tend to show up in changes in…in output, instead.’
FRANK STASIO: When Cagan talks about stickiness in wages and prices, he means the
tendency of wages and prices not to fall in spite of declining demand. Keynesians argue
that the failure of prices to quickly adjust to changes and demand creates a role for
countercyclical policy. To simply set the money-supply growth rate at a constant level
would be poor policy because the relationship between the money supply and economic
activity called, “velocity,” changes from year to year. To counter these changes,
Keynesians argue that the government must lean against the wind, that is, use
countercyclical fiscal and monetary measures. On the other hand, Monetarists hold that
velocity is quite stable, and, as such, monetary growth should be fixed and stable as well.
Professor Cagan says that, at different points in history, both changes in velocity and the
money supply have played the leading part in changes in the business cycle.
PHILIP CAGAN: “Over some periods, the changes in velocity have been rather minor,
and, in other periods, they’ve been rather important. Certainly, in all the major, large
changes in the price level, during major inflationary periods, and those changes in…in
the price level and output that occur over long-run periods, changes in the money supply
have clearly been the most important factor. While velocity does change and has
changed, both in the short run and the long run, its changes have been limited, and the
really large changes have come from the quantity of money. When you look at very
short-run periods where the changes in the quantity of money are not very large, then,
relatively speaking, the velocity changes become important.”
FRANK STASIO: But Monetarists argue that changes in the money supply always come
first. According to Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman, large changes in
velocity are only likely to occur when the government creates uncertainty with erratic

monetary policies. Friedman says that the severe economic slump of nineteen seventy-
nine was an example of the damage that can be caused by discretionary adjustments to
the growth of the money supply. In order to bring down inflation, which had risen to
eleven percent and was still climbing, the Fed, through its open-market operations,
reduced the supply of money to the economy. By 1982, the Feds succeeded in pushing
back inflation to four percent, but the cost was enormous. Unemployment shot up to
more than 11.5 percent, higher than any time since the Depression. Also, at a post-
Depression high was the number of bankruptcies, particularly among small businesses.
Nearly a trillion dollars of potential GNP was lost. Friedman notes that the Fed failed to
follow its own policy, announced in 1979, of adhering to a fixed growth rate in the
money supply to fight inflation.
MILTON FRIEDMAN: “Let me point out, as a matter of, just, fact, that volatility in the
rate of money growth, the fluctuations, the extents of fluctuations, from 1979 to 1982–
three years– is greater than in any other three-year period in the history of the Federal
Reserve. The volatility of interest rates is greater, was greater than any other three-year
period. The volatility of the economy was greater than any other three-year period since
at least the end of World War II. So, these three things, inevitably, in my opinion, go
together. They’re not; it’s not an accident that those three went together. If money
supply is volatile, interest rates are going to be volatile, and the economy is going to be
volatile. That’s why I am in favor of steady monetary growth. That’s why that’s been a
major component of the Monetarist position about monetary policy. The fluctuations in
the money supply are a source of uncertainty in the economy. They affect the economy,
not instantaneously, but with a considerable lag. The Federal Reserve, in trying to offset
changes in the economy, is always, in a sense, fighting the last war. What it does now
has an effect six or nine months from now, with respect to the economy, a year or two
years from now, with respect to inflation. It’s impossible for them to foresee what action
now is appropriate in light of the future. As a result, in my opinion, the actions of the
Federal Reserve have added to the uncertainty, have added to the instability of the
economy, rather than reduced it. And let me emphasize, stable monetary growth is not a
guarantee of stable economy. It’s a guarantee that you will not have disturbing elements

introduced by the operation of monetary policy. It’s a way, I said, for… to keep the
Federal Reserve from doing mischief and not a way to produce nirvana.’
FRANK STASIO: Keynesians claim, the extreme fall in velocity in 1982 shows a flaw
in Friedman’s constant-growth rule. But Friedman argues that the erratic shifts in Fed
policy caused the changes in velocity.
MILTON FRIEDMAN: “The Federal Reserve’s policy from 1979 on, and insofar as it
influenced the course of events, did bring inflation down. But it brought inflation down at
an excessively high cost. And what brought inflation down was not the announced
policy. What brought inflation down as rapidly as it did, was that they introduced so
much uncertainty into the economy by the rapid ups and downs of the money supply, by
the rapid ups and downs in the interest rates, that the business community, as a whole,
was put in a position where it felt it needed much more liquidity to be able to cope with
uncertainty. We have a lot of experience over history, over centuries, that, the more
uncertain the world, the larger the fraction of their resources that people want to keep in a
highly liquid form. And if you put this in technical economic terms you say, velocity of
money declined. And the reason it declined, a major reason it declined, not the only one,
a major reason it declined during that period was because of the increased volatility of the
economy, and the increased uncertainty. And in that sense, you can say the policy
worked. But had they followed their announced policy, had they actually targeted the
money supply, and stuck to their targets, and been consistently steady, you would have
brought inflation down less, in my opinion, than they actually occurred– but at a much
lower cost to the economy without going through these violent gyrations, and with a
greater potential, of keeping your achievement intact in the long run, of continuing along
that road and getting to a stable long-run position.”
FRANK STASIO: Friedman says the government would be better off without a Federal
Reserve System. He and other Monetarists argue that, in the long run, economic stability
is achieved through a steady, predictable growth rate in the money supply.
MILTON FRIEDMAN: “Given that there is a Federal Reserve, the best way for it to
operate would be to set targets for a single monetary aggregate, and stick to those targets,

<!-- Page 8 -->

and keep to them as closely as possible. Those targets should be set so as to go from
wherever you start to a rate of growth in the money supply which is consistent with zero
inflation. If they target them M-1, what’s called, “M-1,” the narrow money supply,
including transferable deposits, if they target them M-1, that means the rate of growth to
about three to five percent a year for M-1, maybe one to three percent a year, somewhere
in that neighborhood. I’m not going to argue about the exact number. They should not
try to achieve that overnight, but they should go from wherever they start, to that number
gradually, over a period of four or five years, and then stay there, and never depart from
it, and keep the money supply as close to that growth as possible.”
FRANK STASIO: The Keynesian-Monetarist debate is not just about the conduct of
monetary policy. Generally speaking, the Monetarist view favors less government
intervention, and the Keynesian approach looks for active involvement. These general
prescriptions hold for both monetary and fiscal policy. The Keynesian theory that
government should run a deficit during a recession to stimulate demand was viewed with
skepticism at first. Philip Cagan.
PHILIP CAGAN: “If you borrow money, in some initial sense you might not create any
additional demand at all. This was one of the points that Keynes was concerned with,
that, when he argued that a deficit would expand aggregate demand, he was arguing
against a view of, prevailing in the British Treasury at that time, that if you tried to, if the
government tried to spend more by simply borrowing money from the public, the
government would spend more, and the public would spend exactly that much less, and
there would be no net change in aggregate demand. And Keynes developed his system in
order to argue that, under those circumstances, there would, in fact, be a change in
aggregate demand. Well, the change as it turns out in his theory comes about because the
government’s borrowing raises the interest rate, and the higher interest rate induces
people to hold less money, so, in that way, you get extra spending from this process, even
though there’s been no increase in the money supply.”
FRANK STASIO: Monetarists argue that the stimulative effect of deficit spending is
offset by a crowding-out of private investment.

PHILIP CAGAN: “Crowding-out is the effect on private investment when the Treasury
runs a deficit and borrows because, as I just mentioned, this process can raise aggregate
spending through a rise in interest rates. But the rise in interest rates can also discourage
private spending in the economy that’s influenced by the interest rates. So, the rise in the
interest rate will not produce as much increase in aggregate spending as would happen if
you would increase the money supply and hadn’t had any increase in the interest rate.
So, there is a crowding-out here of private spending, not as much as the government,
presumably, is spending. But there would be some offset to the…to the government
spending through the deficit, through a process of crowding out private spending, and
this, presumably, would fall mainly on private kinds of investment spending that would
be influenced by this rise in the interest rate.”
FRANK STASIO: Does crowding-out have different effects at different levels of output?
PHILIP CAGAN: “It could, although this has never been clearly demonstrated. If you
were at low levels of output, there might be a couple of things that would happen. First
of all, there would no tendency for prices to increase, which would be an additional
crowding-out effect, so that the effect of the spending showed up in a price increase
rather than an output increase. Low levels of output, there’s very little pressure on prices,
so any increase in spending shows up in output, rather than prices. It might also be
thought that, at very low levels of output, you have a rather flat demand for money
functions, so that any tendency for interest rates to rise produces a considerable reduction
in the amount of money that people want to hold. And, in this way, you don’t get much
of an interest rate increase. You get a lot of extra spending through the rise in velocity,
and, therefore, a little crowding out in this particular case. This has never actually been
demonstrated, but it seems to me there might be some truth in this. So that, at low levels
of output, there is likely to be less crowding out. When you get to very high levels of
output, or, actually, to a full-employment level, then, presumably, the crowding out gets
to be fairly complete in terms of real output because the economy, first of all, is not
capable of producing much more in terms of real output. And, in addition, if you get
very, if you have a fairly steep demand for money function here, then you’re going to get

more of a rise in the interest rate, and most of the Treasury’s extra borrowing is going to
show up in a reduction of private investment.”
FRANK STASIO: Milton Friedman and other Monetarists say that Keynesian
economists try to fine-tune the economy; a task they argue is beyond the reach of even
the best of economists. But those who argue for more active remedies say they can adjust
the economy without the minute changes suggested by the phrase “fine-tuning.”
MILTON FRIEDMAN: “That, you know, conjures up a picture of people twiddling the
dials and…and running policy in a way that is, you know, beyond anyone’s imagination,
certainly beyond mine.”
FRANK STASIO: Walter Heller was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors
under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
WALTER HELLER: “And it involves a certain amount of chutzpah, that you could
move this economy by small degrees, hither and thither. I don’t think that the concept,
change it to ‘gross-tuning,’ not fine tuning. I don’t think that concept is at all out of date
in the sense that, if the economy is sliding or is failing to achieve its objectives, full
employment, and so forth, that you do have to adjust monetary policy and, if possible,
fiscal policy, taxes and spending, to achieve either an offset to recession, or to achieve the
full-employment potential of the economy. I don’t think that concept is gone at all. And
in particular, I think what’s worth saying in light of the Monetarist, the Friedman point of
view, that you should just set the dials at one level and let the economy, then, adjust, so to
speak, to a steady growth of the money supply. I just don’t believe in that. It seems to
me that, with all the information we have about the economy, there should be feedback.
You should constantly feedback, into the policy process, what you can learn from the
economy, and then adjust policy, not every day, not every week, not every month, but
over a cycle, or, in light of various crises that hit the economy, you ought to adjust it in
the light of the information. I don’t think you should deny yourself that information.”

FRANK STASIO: The debate over stabilization policy is not restricted to the
Monetarists and Keynesian views. A theory of rational expectations has received some
attention as well.
PHILIP CAGAN: “It’s a view that’s grown up in recent years in response to the
importance of…of expectations in econometric model building and a criticism of the
typical way in which expectations were handled in econometric models previously.
Previously, a typical way was adaptive expectations in which an expected values of
variables--which were, of course, important in explaining how the public responded to
changes in variables-- the expectation under the adaptive method would usually assume
that the public would adapt their expectations to what was actually happening. A result
of this was that expectations were always slowly adjusting to what was going on in the
economy, and this often seemed rather irrational on the part of the public, because they
might be making the same mistake in their expectations, for months and years in a row
if…if the changes going on were always operating in the same direction, and they were
always slowly adjusting to what was going on. And so it grew up that an idea in
economic modeling might be better, to assume that the public’s expectations were always
going to be unbiased, which is to say that they might make mistakes, but they would not
be systematic mistakes. People would not make the mistake over and over again.”
FRANK STASIO: Cagan explains how rational expectation theorists might come to
different conclusions about business activity.
PHILIP CAGAN: “First of all, if you take the adaptive expectations approach, if
inflation begins to develop, you, in the adaptive expectations, the public does not
immediately respond to this developing inflation. So, the rise in prices is a surprise to the
public– their money holdings don’t fall as much as they otherwise would if the public had
been more alert as to the rise in the inflation rate– and the other adjustments that they
might make are much slower, so that prices and wages in general would be more sluggish
in their response to this increasing inflationary pressure. Under rational expectations, it’s
imagined that the public will see that inflation is developing as soon as it occurs, both,
because it will understand what the monetary authorities are doing in terms of the money

supply, and what effect this is having on aggregate demand in the price level.
Consequently, the effects of inflation on the demand for money will occur immediately
or, perhaps, even ahead of time as the public seeks to adjust its money balances to the
coming inflation. Prices and wages in the economy will adjust ahead of time, or,
certainly, would not without any lag to the coming inflationary pressures. And
consequently, if inflationary pressures are coming along, under rational expectations, the
effect on prices in the economy will be much stronger because of the anticipation by the
public over this inflationary pressure.”
FRANK STASIO: Economists who support the rational expectations theory, argue that
government activism can be self-defeating because firms and individuals will neutralize
government policy by anticipating its effects. Another approach that has influenced
government policymaking in recent years is supply-side economics. It, too, argues that
government activism does more harm than good. Supply-side economists focus on the
elimination of federal policies that discourage long-term growth.
PHILIP CAGAN: “These would be governmental policies that would influence the way
in which goods are supplied in the economy. This would pertain, most particularly, to
taxation policies. If you tax something that discourages its production, if you have
marginal taxes on people’s earnings, it discourages their efforts. You have high taxation
on the returns from investment; it discourages investment, and investment in capital
goods that can produce future growth. So, these kinds of government policies definitely
influence the supply of goods in the economy. But there might be other government
policies, controls over pollution, which would influence the chemical industry, other
kinds of regulations in different industries that may inhibit either the incentive to produce
certain goods or influence the kinds of goods that are produced. So, there’s a whole array
of government influences on the economy, particularly since the 1930s when the
government has intervened to a much greater extent in the economy.”
FRANK STASIO: How does it differ from the demand management policies that we’ve
had since the thirties?
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 13 -->

PHILIP CAGAN: “Well, I would say the main difference is that the demand
management policies tend to look at the economy in the macro-sense from an overall
point of view. Is that total amount of spending in the economy appropriate? Is the
movement of the price level going too rapid, or should we try to reduce inflation? So, we
don’t focus on a particular area of the economy, but look at the economy as a whole.
Supply-side factors always focus on a particular sector. What is the price doing to this
particular industry? What are taxes doing to a particular industry? What are taxes doing
to investment? What are regulations, environmental, and other kinds, doing to particular
industries? It’s very hard to think of supply-side policies as influencing the whole
economy in the same way that our aggregate demand policies do.”
FRANK STASIO: Let’s review some of the important ideas in our discussion of
Stabilization Policy. Monetarism stresses the relationship between the money supply and
sharp swings in the business cycle. This differs with the early Keynesian view that
changes in the money supply are the result and not the cause of shifts in the business
cycle. Today, Keynesians hold that change in the rate of growth of the money supply is
only one of many factors that affect the business cycle. Keynesians and Monetarists have
also differed over the volatility of spending and the desire to hold liquid assets.
Monetarists believe that spending and velocity are inherently stable. Partly because of
this view, Monetarists advocate a fixed growth rate for the money supply. They also
maintain that the lags between the creation of monetary policy and its effect often result
in the policy being pro-cyclical. That is, it feeds economic trends, rather than work
against those trends, to keep them under control. For these reasons, they argue that
discretionary adjustments to the money supply create uncertainty and ultimately do more
harm than good. Keynesian economists see spending and the economy as much more
volatile. They advocate discretionary changes in the money supply and fiscal policy that
work against the business cycle. The proper countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies
will, in the Keynesian view, take out the booms and busts in the business cycle. Another
theoretical argument that concerns stabilization policy is the rational expectations theory.
This theory holds that government efforts to stabilize the economy are offset by the
actions of firms and individuals who will anticipate changes in economic activity and
take steps to protect themselves against the adverse trends. These preemptive moves

would tend to neutralize federal policy prescriptions. Still another point of view, but one
that is not, strictly speaking, directed toward stabilization policy, is that held by supply-
side theorists. Supply-side theories seek to stimulate aggregate supply in the long run
through tax reductions, and through changes in burdensome standards and regulations. It
is important to understand that there is a wide disagreement over stabilization policies,
even within the various schools mentioned here. But economists argue that stabilization
policies, if they’re to work at all, must evolve with changes in economic behavior.
Theories on stabilization of the economy, which may have applied to one set of
circumstances, are not always helpful in other situations.
