century micro and macroeconomic principles. The subject of this edition is Public Goods and
Taxation. Our guest is Joseph Peckman, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution. I’m Frank

WALTER MONDALE: “By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by
two-thirds. Let’s tell the truth. That must be done. It must be done. Mister Reagan will raise
taxes, and so will I. He won’t tell you. I just did.”
FRANK STASIO: Former Democratic Presidential candidate Walter Mondale surprised a lot of
people when he made higher taxes a campaign promise. Four years earlier, Ronald Reagan was
swept into office on the promise to do just the opposite. And when Reagan did cut taxes, his
popularity in most quarters of the country grew. For Mondale to say he would return to higher
taxes seemed like political suicide. But Mondale didn’t think so. The Reagan tax cut forced
government to cut spending, and go more deeply into debt. Mondale was betting that Americans
had begun to worry about that debt and would be willing to pay more in taxes rather than bear

the huge cost of carrying the deficit over a long period of time. Also, Mondale was trying to
appeal to those Americans whose benefits had been reduced or eliminated.
WALTER MONDALE: “We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits
hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids,
and shrink our future. Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay
Mister Reagan’s bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says
they won’t is not telling the truth to the American people.”
FRANK STASIO: Mondale lost the bet. In the end, the country decided it wanted lower taxes
and less government spending in some areas. Of course, there were other reasons for Ronald
Reagan’s victory in 1984, but, clearly, the tax issue played a large part. The subject of taxes is
always a hot topic because almost everybody pays them. Americans are not only sensitive about
how much the government takes from them in taxes, but also they’re concerned about how the
government spends their money. Still, everyone believes the government has some
responsibility to get involved in the economy. Joseph Peckman is a Senior Fellow at the
Brookings Institution.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “Well, the government has to provide those goods and services that, uh,
individuals need and which cannot be sold on the marketplace. So, for example, national
defense, having an army, and a navy and an air force, is something that the people can’t provide
for themselves. And what happens is, the government provides it. Moreover, such services and
goods have the characteristic that they provide national defense for you and for me and for
everybody else, without reducing the supply of national defense to…to anybody just, which is
different from a good that is sold on the marketplace. If I buy a pair of shoes, you can’t buy it,
you see, whereas if…if I benefit from police and fire protection, you also benefit from the same
kind of protection. Since we don’t know, and no individual can evaluate, how much national
defense or police and fire protection is worth to him or her, there would be no way you…you
could create a market. On the other hand, to take shoes as an example, you and I, while we don’t
think of it in those terms, you and I have some conception of how much a pair of shoes is worth
to us. And if the pair, if the shoes are too expensive, we don’t buy them. If they’re just about
right, we do.”

FRANK STASIO: Our willingness to pay taxes to support public goods hinges on the benefits
we believe we derive from government programs. It’s easy to see how everybody in the country
benefits from some kind of national defense program, though there may be arguments about how
much is enough. Other public goods and services may have less direct impact on the population
as a whole. Although, as Joseph Peckman points out, in many cases the indirect benefits may be
substantial.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “There are many goods and services that are what are called ‘mixed
goods,’ partly private and partly public. Two good examples of mixed goods that government
provides are: health, and education. In both cases, obviously, the individual does– who receives
the benefit– the individual does benefit from the service. And in that respect, there’s a private
benefit. At the same time, everybody else is benefited. If we can eradicate disease, for example,
not only does the person who’s diseased get the benefit, but society as a whole gets the benefit
of…of the disease eradication. Similarly, if we educate a poor person that poor person will be
able to earn income and, therefore, have a private benefit, but, in addition to that, you and I don’t
have to pay for welfare expenditures that we…we might otherwise have to pay. Those kinds of
goods, the mixed kinds of goods, I think, other than national defense, constitute most of the
budget.”
MALE VOICE: “The victory for Proposition Thirteen is the opening battle and the new
American Revolution. We have a new revolution against the arrogant politicians and insensitive
bureaucrats whose philosophy, a tax, tax, tax, spend, spend, spend, elect and elect and elect, is
bankrupting we the American people, and the time has come to put a stop to it.”
FRANK STASIO: In a democracy, we have some voice in whether and to what extent education
and national defense and other goods and services should be provided by the government. As
Peckman has said, it is sometimes difficult to place a value on public goods. It can also be
difficult to tell who benefits directly and who enjoys indirect benefits. But taxpayers keep a
good deal of pressure on government to charge those who gain from government programs.
### Economists call this “the benefit principle.”

JOSEPH PECKMAN: “The first thing the government should do is to levy benefit taxes, to the
extent that is necessary. That is, people shouldn’t get benefits from…from services provided by

<!-- Page 5 -->

government, free of charge. If that’s done, what happens is that they use too much of
those…those services, and we’re misallocating our resources. And there are many examples of
the things, of things that government provides that…that are paid for, in fact, by individuals.
The simplest example I can think…think of are parking meters in…in local governments. We
use up space when we park our…our cars. That benefits us, and it clogs the highways and…and
streets. So, we put up park…, the government puts up parking meters and charges a quarter or a
half a dollar an hour. Whether this is an exact value of it, we don’t know, but there’s an attempt
to do that. Similarly, business will use governmental facilities, for example, navigational
facilities for…for aircraft. Fees are paid for those navigation facilities. In effect, the government
is providing goods and services rather than the market, and if you can evaluate that, every public
finance economist would say that you ought to require the individual who benefits from these
services to pay for them.”
FRANK STASIO: The government may also tax firms and individuals who create costs that
would otherwise be borne by the public at large. Peckman says the government imposes
environmental controls for this reason. So that businesses that pollute the environment will
either pay for the cleanup or compensate for the damage.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “If we don’t tax or regulate pollution, the absence of the tax means that
somebody else is paying for it in terms of polluted streams and…and air. And the…and the
people who are paying for it are the consumers. And the, what economists would say is, that
that’s unfair. The consumer shouldn’t pay that burden, shouldn’t bear that burden, but the
burden should be on the polluters and on the people who buy the goods and services produced by
the polluters. And so, more recently, we have been imposing taxes on polluters, like the super
fund that is being used to clean up chemical wastes and chemical dumps. We are now, actually,
imposing taxes on people who pollute or destroy the property that belongs to all of us, you see.
But the objective of such pollution taxes would be to impose the tax on the…on the people
who…who actually do the polluting, and to moderate or eliminate the tax on people who don’t
have anything to do with the pollution.”
FRANK STASIO: The government imposes benefit taxes where possible, but, in many cases,
charging a user for the benefits they receive would be impractical or counterproductive. It’s

almost impossible to know the relative value to each individual of running the federal
government or providing for national defense. Also, it makes little sense to charge poor people
to participate in programs designed to improve their living conditions. Still, the government
must collect taxes to pay for these programs.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “The question is, how should these general taxes be levied? The history
of…of most democratic countries indicates that the basic rule is that, we should tax ability to
pay, in accordance with ability to pay. Now, there are difference of opinion about what ability to
pay is, and whether you can define it. But I think most people believe that, the richer you are,
the more ability to pay you…you have. And that the tax system should be progressive, which
means that as you, as your income rises, you should pay not only a higher tax, but a higher
proportion of your income in taxes. That’s a definition of a progressive tax.”
FRANK STASIO: Americans turn over more than three hundred billion dollars to the federal
government every year in the form of income tax. As Peckman has said, the income tax is
progressive. The 1981 tax bill set a ceiling for personal income at a rate of fifty percent. So, the
rate at which income is taxed increases until it reaches fifty percent. Peckman says, there are
certain consequences of income taxation that extend beyond simply financing federal programs.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “One thing we know is, that, to a certain extent, much less than most
people believe, the income tax makes the distribution of income after tax a little more equal than
the distribution before tax; since we take more…more money from rich people, it…it affects the
distribution of income. A second thing is that the income tax affects individual work and saving
behavior, and investment behavior, and, to that extent, it may…it may have an economic effect.
At one time, we didn’t, we really had no basis for making judgments about these economic
effects. More recently, I think economists have…have made some progress about measuring the
economic impact of taxation.”
FRANK STASIO: Throughout 1970s and ‘80s, a growing number of economists, like Arthur
Laffer, began to argue that high taxes cut into productivity. They said that income taxes had
risen so high that workers had less and less incentive to work.

MALE VOICE: “People don’t work to pay taxes. People work to get what they can after tax.
People don’t increase the productivity of their capital, or their labor, or their production process,
to give the money away to the government. They do it to make more profits, themselves. And
when you cut the taxes, you increase their incentives for doing that activity, and you’ll increase
productivity, output and employment. Who cares about productivity when you don’t get any
benefits from it?”
RONALD REAGAN: “We move on to the individual, you and me, and my proposal is for a ten-
percent cut in the income tax across the board, not a special cut for someone, while someone
else, you know, rob Peter and pay Paul. We’re all named Peter today. Ten percent, a ten percent
in 1982, and another ten percent in 1983, a thirty-percent cut over a three-year period.”
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “It turns out that, in our kind of society, it’s very difficult for many
people to vary…vary the number of hours they work because they have, they, most firms require
you to work forty hours in…in the United States. However, there are people who work for
themselves, doctors and lawyers and accountants, farmers, who are affected by…by taxation.
And there are also secondary earners in the family. There’s, mainly, working spouses whose
income is not essential, not as essential as the primary income of the family and they…and they
might vary their hours. Measurements of economists suggest that…that the tax, the income tax,
and the payroll tax, provide much more of a disincentive to married women than to…to men.”
FRANK STASIO: Corporations also pay income tax. The federal government has a claim on a
portion of corporate profits the same as it has on individual earnings. But in the case of personal
income tax, it’s clear who pays the bill. It’s the individual wage earner. Corporate taxes,
however, are not borne solely by the owners of the corporation. Part of the cost is usually passed
on to consumers, in the form of higher prices, and workers, in the form of lower wages. The
question of who bears the actual cost of a tax regardless of who pays it is called “the incidence of
a tax.”
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “A good example of that is the payroll tax. Part of our payroll tax is paid
by the employer, and the other part is paid by the employee. Everybody agrees that the
employee’s part is not only paid by the employee, but he bears the tax. There are differences of
opinion, mostly by non-experts, about the employer’s share. Some people believe that, somehow

<!-- Page 8 -->

or other, the employer pays it out of…out of his profits. Well, I think that most economists
would say that, even though the employer pays the, half the payroll tax, actually, the total tax is
borne by the worker. Otherwise, the costs of the…of the payroll tax would increase the cost, of
the employer, and he would tend to try to either, well, he would either not produce the…the
goods or services he produces with that…that, the…the time put in by the worker. Or, he will
try to cut back on the…on the wages of the employer. In some…, payroll taxation is a tax on
workers even though part of it is paid by the…the employer. A lot of people believe that
the…the tax paid by landlords on the property really is borne by the…the tenant. That is it’s
shifted in…in higher rents, but, again, there’s a group of economists that believes that, in this
particular case, that a landlord pays…pays the property tax and that is not shifted forward to
renters. So, these are examples of cases where the incident of the tax…of the tax may not be the
same as the person who pays the tax initially.”
FRANK STASIO: What determines the ability of a particular business to pass on a tax? When
is it easier to do that?
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “Well, it’s easier to do it when…when consumers will…will buy the
product, whether or not you increase the price. This is called “elasticity of the demand for…for
a product.” And a good example of…of a what is called “an inelastic demand” is the demand for
liquor. At some price people won’t…won’t buy liquor, but if you only put a twelve-dollar tax
on…on a gallon of liquor, which is what we do in the United States today, while some
consumption of liquor is discouraged, there’s still an awful lot of consumption. And we…we
collect for the four million dollars of taxes from those, from such taxes. So, the, I would say that
it is easier for a firm to pass on the tax, the greater the inelasticity of…of demand for the
product.”
FRANK STASIO: There are also sales taxes imposed at the state and local level which are
assessed against manufacturers, but paid ultimately by consumers, and payroll taxes like Social
Security and Medicare. These other taxes are regressive. That is, they’re paid at the same rate,
regardless of income.

<!-- Page 9 -->

JOSEPH PECKMAN: “ Even though we have an income tax, we also have some regressive
taxes or taxes that take less proportionately from the wealthy, and they sort of balance out. And
for the entire tax system, the federal, state, and local tax system put together, I find that there’s
virtually no, very little progressivity left, even after you take into account the income taxes, at
the federal, state, and local... at the federal, state level.”
FRANK STASIO: Another assessment levied by governments is the property tax. Property
taxes are assessed at the local level, based on the value of one’s real and sometimes personal
property. Property tax falls in the gray area between one that is based on the ability to pay, since
it’s related to the value of the property, and one that is set according to the benefits received by
the taxpayer.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “There’s a long argument among public finance economists about
whether property taxes are taxes or…or a, fees for benefits for received. My own view is that
it’s…it’s part of both. Obviously, most people who pay property taxes do benefit from local
services, like police, fire protection, and roads and so on. And in that respect, it’s a benefit tax,
but we also pay for schools and health and so on, which are not directly given to…to many
individuals in the community who are paying property taxes at the time. Over a lifetime, I think
it sort of averages out, but, in any case, I think that’s a…that’s a good case, the property tax,
where you might regard it as part of benefit tax, and partly a general tax.”
FRANK STASIO: Peckman says that many economists believe the tax system should not single
out individuals, firms, or industries for special treatment or sanction. By selecting certain
industries for various tax exemptions, the government encourages the misallocation of resources
through the creation of tax shelters.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “A tax shelter is simply an investment by, usually, by wealthy individuals
or corporations, which, after one takes advantage of all of the special provisions in the tax law,
turns out that the income from…from that activity is either not taxed or pays very little tax. And
as a result of that, as a result of the existence of the tax shelters, of all sorts in many industries,
there has been a lot of investment in those industries. And presumably, if we didn’t have those
tax shelters, the money would have flowed into other…other types of investments, which the
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 10 -->

market would have evaluated on the basis of their…their before-tax-rate of return rather than on
the basis of their tax advantages.”
FRANK STASIO: Instead of creating tax shelters, Peckman and other economists argue that the
tax code should be neutral. That is, taxes should not encourage or inhibit investment in any
particular industry.
JOSEPH PECKMAN: “If we have an income tax, the income tax should bear equally on firms
and people with the same income. That is not the case under the law in effect now. And as a
result, we have more activity in certain industries and less in other industries, or consumers
derive income from certain things they wouldn’t derive otherwise because there…there are tax
advantages. And what economists say is that we, the tax system should provide what is called ‘a
level playing field,’ that people should…should all have the same advantages or disadvantages
and not have more advantages than others. Again, the tax shelter illustration is…is exactly what
I have in mind. As a result of tax shelters we have much more commercial construction in this
country. I don’t think people realize, but even hotels, and ski lodges, and vacation resorts, all of
that kind of construction is usually constructed from tax shelter money. I don’t, have nothing
against ski…ski lodges and vacation resorts, but I don’t think that people who construct
such…such structures should get tax advantages out of them. And maybe we, if we had fewer of
that, we would have more investment and more productive industries and we’d…and we’d grow
faster. I think the major point is that we oughtn’t discriminate. Once we…once we decide on
what kind of tax we want, we ought to tax all people and all…all firms exactly the same way
rather than to give some of them the option of getting out from under, either by tax evasion,
which is bad, or by legal means, such as tax shelters.”
FRANK STASIO: While there is widespread agreement that the tax code contains too many
special preferences, attempts to create a neutral tax structure general meet with strong political
resistance. This is because most individuals take advantage of one or more of these loopholes
and can organize to keep their particular preference from being eliminated. Now, let’s review
some of the main points in our discussion about public goods and taxation. The government
provides goods and services that it believes are necessary and would not otherwise be made
available by the free-market system. Private industry may not be able to provide some services

<!-- Page 11 -->

because of the difficulty in determining the value of the service to individuals and the practical
problems firms might have collecting payment. There are some services, like national defense,
that can be enjoyed collectively without reducing the benefit to any individual. There are two
basic principles that determine how taxes should be levied. When possible, the government
charges a fee for services as in the case of parking meters or landing fees. Such charges are
based on the benefit principle. It is sometimes impossible to determine the direct beneficiaries of
government services, or the beneficiaries may be unable to pay. So, the government must pay
for them through general taxes such as income tax. Income tax is based on the ability to pay, and
income tax is progressive, that is, the rate of taxation rises with the level of income. Other taxes
like sales and payroll taxes are regressive. They’re levied at the same rate, regardless of income.
Both individuals and corporations pay income tax. In the case of individual tax, it’s clear that
the taxpayer bears the cost. With corporations, it’s not so simple. Corporations may pass along
their tax payment to the consumer in the form of higher prices. Corporate taxes may also result
in lower wages. The question of who actually bears the cost of the tax, regardless of who pays it,
is called “the incidence of a tax.” Many economists argue that taxes should not single one
industry over others for special treatment. By doing so, the government may encourage the
misallocation of resources. Finally, attempts to create a neutral tax structure, eliminating special
preferences for various investments, usually meets with strong political resistance. While there
may be a general agreement that there are too many exceptions in the tax law, most individuals
take advantage of one or more of these loopholes, and fight to keep their preference from being
eliminated.
