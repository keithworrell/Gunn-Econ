FRANK STASIO: Twelve thousand miles separates the People’s Republic of China
from the United States, but there was an even greater distance that had kept the two
countries apart for decades that preceded Richard Nixon’s historic trip to China.
Ideological differences between the Capitalist United States and the Communist China
made the possibility of Sino American trade politically impossible. But because of
changing foreign and domestic priorities in both the U.S. and China, trade became a
possibility in the early 1970s. But, for Richard Nixon, who had built part of his career on
a hard-line anti-Communist stance, announcing a visit to the world’s largest communist
country was risky. Chinese leaders, too, faced opposition within the Communist Party
for opening the doors to a nation they frequently denounced as imperialist, and exploited.

Why were both sides willing to gamble? The simple answer is that they both believed
they had something to gain. It may be easy to see why the United States wanted to export
to China. With its nine hundred million people, China is the largest market in the world,
an irresistible prospect for the world’s biggest producer. But what would the U.S. import
from China? The United States can make almost anything it wants more cheaply than
China. In this sense, the United States is said to have an absolute advantage over China,
but to see the benefits of free trade we need to look at more than the efficiency of one
country’s industry compared with another. We need to see the relative benefits of
allowing one country to supply a portion of our needs to free resources for more
productive purposes. Robert Lawrence is a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “In fact, there were two kinds of competition that are involved
in international competition. On the one hand, country…um, industries within an
economy are competing with one another in order to attract resources into their sector.
Uh, our computer industry, and our textile industry, both, must hire labor, and therefore
they compete with one another in attracting that labor into their industries. On the other
hand, our computer industry also competes with computer industries abroad. So, there
are actually two, uh, forms of competition going on simultaneously, and, therefore, it’s
not only how our computer industry competes with computer industries abroad that will
determine international…success in international competition, but it’s also the
comparative advantage, or how well our computer industry does rela…in international
trade relative to how our textile industry does in international trade that will influence the
outcome.”
FRANK STASIO: The question in determining comparative advantage is, ‘what does a
non-trading country have to give up by producing everything itself?’ Suppose the United
States could trade one computer to China for three thousand shirts. Now, let’s say that to
produce the same three thousand shirts in the United States, it would take the resources
needed to make one and half computers. Even if sure production in the United States was
more efficient than in China, it would be in our best interest to put more of our resources
into computer production and buy our shirts from China. Lawrence says that when a

country discovers it has a “comparative advantage,” market forces will drive the country
towards specialization.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “If the computer industry can afford to pay workers, say,
fifteen dollars an hour in order to work in the computer industry, and if the computer
industry can still make a profit in…in paying those workers fifteen dollars an hour, the
textile industry is gonna have to try to match that wage. If they’re unable to do that, what
we’ll find is a textile industry that shrinks and a computer industry that grows, and,
indeed, that’s why, over time, we found our labor being allocated to the more efficient
industries and away from the less efficient industries, and it’s how international
competition– which is one force which leads us to specialize, say, in the production of
computers rather than the production of textiles– reinforces this allocation of our
resources within our labor market.”
FRANK STASIO: Lawrence says differences in comparative advantage can be attributed
to a number of factors.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “Some economies, like those in the Middle East, have a lot of
oil. Other economies have climates that are favorable to produce one product or another,
so one major source of comparative advantage comes from the natural resource
endowments of the economy. A second reason maybe…comes from what are called the
factors of production available in that economy. Some economies are very rich and they
have a lot of equipment and/or capital. Other economies have a lot of labor, and,
therefore, factor endowments will also tend to influence the comparative advantage of
countries. In… countries which tend to have a relatively large amount of capital
equipment will tend to specialize in products that require a lot of capital equipment. So, a
second major source of comparative advantage comes from the factors of production,
land, labor, capital, which an economy has been endowed with. A third source of
comparative advantage may well come from knowledge available in one economy that’s
not available in a second. The United States may possess technological know-how,
which other economies don’t possess, and, therefore, one would expect to see the United
States specializing along the lines of…in areas where it has a particular kind of

<!-- Page 5 -->

know-how. And, then, finally, countries’ overall environments may allow them to
produce products which other countries would not permit, and so, we can actually…we
actually find that government regulations or social regulations may well influence what a
country can specialize in. If we Americans have a…do not wish to have a lot of pollution
in our economy, we can put stringent regulations against pollution, and what we’ll find is
that we will tend to import products from countries that have a greater tolerance for
pollution than we do.”
FRANK STASIO: Because of their size and productivity, American industries had at one
time considered themselves invulnerable to foreign competition, but, as labor costs
increased in the U.S. and other countries gained technological know-how once limited to
the United States, foreign products began to penetrate the American market. The steel,
auto, and textile industries were the most severely affected. Labor leaders and
management officials warned that allowing cheap imports into the United States would
force Americans to lower their standard of living, as market forces pushed wages and
prices lower. However, economists like Robert Lawrence believe just the opposite
occurs.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “Let’s imagine that, overnight, in the United States, we were to
discover a huge amount of oil in this economy. Well, clearly, what we would say is that
our economy would be made better off. We’d be better off. Let’s ask what would
happen in a second case, if the Canadians discovered a huge amount of oil, three times
the current world supply, and were willing to sell it to us. Well, it’s true we’d have to
pay the Canadians something for that oil, but, again, we’d sit back and say, our living
standards would be raised as a result of the ability to obtain that oil cheaply from another
country. Now, of course, we would also agree that some citizens in our economy, in
particular, the Texas oil magnates would be made worse off as a result of the availability
of that oil, but we, as a nation, would be made better off, potentially, because, now, we
would be able to take the resources that we are currently devoting to oil production and
put them to some other use. The proof requires, though, a very important assumption,
and that is that we can take those resources which were once in oil, or we can take those
workers who once produced textiles and put them to work in some alternative activity. If

they simply lay idle, then we couldn’t be so sure that we would be better off. So, the
proposition that trade makes our nation better off hinges critically on our ability to
re-employ the resources that are freed up when we obtain what they once produced, from
the rest of the world.”
FRANK STASIO: But shifting trade patterns that cause structural change can cause
hardship and practical difficulties. It might require geographic relocation for workers.
Older workers may find it difficult to be retrained in a new industry, and there will be a
time when workers in older industries will be out of a job. Some are laid off indefinitely.
The painful short-term adjustments caused by shifts in trade patterns often create political
pressure to protect declining industries against foreign competition.
MALE VOICE: “Well, there’s no question about it. We’re in deep trouble, and,
specifically, right here in Tarrytown where about two thousand people will be laid off.
They’re in deep trouble. I don’t know any place in the State of New York where there’s
anybody gonna hire two thousand people.”
FRANK STASIO: But economists argue that efforts to stand in the way of free trade
result in higher costs for consumers. Some of those costs are obvious, some are hidden.
In nineteen eighty, when it appeared that Congress was about to impose rigid barriers
aimed at controlling Japanese auto imports, the Japanese agreed to place a voluntary limit
on the number of cars they would send to the United States.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “The estimates are that those restraints raised the cost of a car
in the United States by something like six hundred dollars, and, in fact, raised the costs of
the imports of Japanese cars by something like two thousand dollars. Well, clearly, some
of the benefits of raising the um, some…some of the costs of raising the…of the costs of
automobiles domestically in this country, the costs to consumers were then benefits to our
producers, so they weren’t lost to the nation, but they were a redistribution from
consumers to producers. On the other hand, by putting on quotas, we also provided
benefits to foreigners as well. Now, a second way of looking at protection is to ask, what
were the costs to consumers of each job that we saved in our industry, in our auto
industry, and, there, the estimate suggests that the cost to consumers was something like a

<!-- Page 7 -->

hundred and sixty thousand dollars for each job we saved in the auto industry. So what
you can see is that, by using trade protection in order to increase employment, we have a
very inefficient mechanism. Standing back, consumers would have been much better off
to simply provide the salaries of those workers who would have otherwise been laid off
than doing it indirectly through trade protection.”
JOHN DINGLE: “This kind of fellow looks at the problem that, uh, a consumer has in
terms of paying a little more for the goods.”
FRANK STASIO: John Dingle is a Democratic congressman from Michigan and
Chairman of the House Commerce Committee. His district was deeply affected by
falling sales in the auto industry, caused, in part, by the success of foreign imports.
JOHN DINGLE: “At this particular time, he doesn’t look at the future increases… are
gonna be loaded on once our American automobile industry and other industries are
down the tube, nor does he look at the economic consequences of being dependent on
goods abroad. He doesn’t look at the other costs that are associated with this. In a
consequence, he is breeding himself a splendid future and present disaster because he’s
not looking at the world as it really exists.”
FRANK STASIO: Dingle was one of the leaders of a movement in Congress to impose
restrictions on foreign auto imports. The most direct way to restrict imports is by quotas.
Quotas are restrictions on the number of units a foreign manufacturer may bring into the
country. Another effective way to reduce the impact of foreign competition is to impose
a tariff, or a tax on imported goods. The effect is to raise the price to consumers,
neutralizing its price advantage over domestic products. Dingle and others argue that
many foreign manufacturers have gained trade advantages with the help of their
governments. Government subsidies offset production costs and allow foreign
competitors to sell their products at very low prices. Protectionists say, that, without
similar help from the U.S. government, American industry will fall victim to unfair
competition.

JOHN DINGLE: “Almost every country has quotas on importation of Japanese
automobiles. The French say that they can bring in any number, but only two or three
percent will leave the dock, the Italians allowing twenty-three hundred, the British
allowing approximately ten percent, Germans approximately 10 percent. The Japanese,
however, will set up automobile industries around the world in the full expectation that
those automobile industries as well as their own are going to be exporting into the United
States. So, I felt that it was absolutely necessary, in view of the grotesquely unfair trade
practices of our trading partners, especially the Japanese, that real quotas and domestic
content requirements equal to those other nations should be laid in place by the United
### States.”

FRANK STASIO: Dingle says that foreign competitors are not playing fairly. He argues
that world trade is, in effect, not played on a level field. It’s a persuasive argument for
erecting barriers to free trade, but Robert Lawrence warns that such barriers should be
imposed selectively.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “What we have to acknowledge is that we live in a world of
very diverse economies, and it’s very difficult for us, in fact, ever, to get a level playing
field in international competition in the same way that we have it in domestic
competition. After all, two firms competing domestically exist in the same environment.
It… the very reason why international trade occurs, economists teach us, is that those
environments differ. So, in my view, the playing field of international trade will always
be sloped, one way or the other. The best we can do actually is to agree on the rules of
the game. Now, let’s look at what our international trade laws actually say. What they
say is that we…we do not agree that subsidies should be…we do not allow subsidies, and
we don’t agree to them, but, nonetheless, if we find that a foreign government is
subsidizing exports to this country and we don’t find, though, that our domestic industry
is being injured, we will allow those to take place. On the other hand, if that industry can
prove that it is being injured as a result of those subsidies, and it can do so to the
satisfaction of our international trade commission, then, we will put on a countervailing
duty. We will put on a tariff that offsets the effect of the subsidy. Now, that seems to me

<!-- Page 9 -->

a reasonable way to deal with the problem, to provide the benefits to consumers, provided
that there is no massive injury or injury in some sense to our producers.”
FRANK STASIO: Lawrence says that if trade barriers must be imposed, the quota is not
the most efficient way to protect workers against economic hardship due to foreign
competition.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “You can get the same amount of protection by a tariff as you
could by an equivalent quota. You could set the price or the tax on imports at exactly the
same so that you would bring in the same quantity as you might under a quota. So, you
can obtain initially the same amount of protection, but the effects of a tariff are subtly
different from those of a quota in a number of ways. Firstly, what a quota does is to
restrict the quantity that foreigners can sell in the home market but allow them to raise
their price. So, in fact, a quota provides increased profits per unit for a foreigner selling
in the protected market. On the other hand, the tariff taxes that foreigner, and doesn’t
permit him to enjoy those increased profits. That’s why, typically, foreigners are more
likely to agree to quotas than they are to tariffs, and, uh, indeed over…that’s why we’ve
been able to persuade the Japanese, if you will, and others, to agree to what are called
voluntary export restraints because, while they now can sell smaller quantity, they can
raise the price against us and capture increased monopoly profits. And, really, if we sit
back and we say, if the reason for providing that quota protection, is to provide our own
industry a chance, a breathing space to modernize, we can see that, actually, quotas by
channeling profits to foreign producers, aren’t a very sensible way of…of doing that.”
FRANK STASIO: Protectionists sometimes argue that, without trade barriers like tariffs
and quotas to protect some industries, our national defense could be compromised. Here,
again, Lawrence and other economists say that we may do better to be more selective in
deciding whom we protect.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “A free market system, in which countries specialize along the
lines of comparative advantage, may well render a country vulnerable in terms of its
national defense requirements. If, for example, it turned out that the United States lost its
comparative advantage in the steel industry, if we simply allowed the free market to
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 10 -->

allocate resources, we may discover that we have no domestic steel industry. We’re
simply importing our steel from the rest of the world. Purely from an efficiency
standpoint, that may be a good and a desirable change, but viewed from a national
defense perspective, that may be an undesirable change. Well, some people have argued
that since we may be rendered vulnerable as a result of international trade, what we ought
to do is to interfere or intervene with a trade process in order to protect our national
defense industries. I would argue that that is not the appropriate response, because it’s
likely to be a very inefficient one. Let’s take the case of steel as a case in point. It turns
out that at the moment only seven percent of our steel production really goes into national
defense. Now, it would really, therefore, be quite…quite inefficient to protect the entire
steel industry in order to maintain what’s essential for the national defense base. I
believe it would be much more efficient if we met that need by insisting that our defense
planners subsidize the production of products which they think are critical for the
national defense need. Let’s meet the national defense need, if you will, through our
defense budget. That way we are likely to have a much more efficient mechanism for
meeting our national defense needs. We’re unlikely to subsidize plants that are required
for some other kind of purpose.”
FRANK STASIO: Protectionism also gains support when the goal is to nurture infant
industries. Developing countries, wanting to build industrialized economies, may choose
to erect trade barriers to give their domestic industries a chance to become competitive
with their trading partners.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “That case has some merit for developing countries, which
have potential in particular areas, but their industries require some time to get on their
feet. Typically, however, we are from the point of view of the United States, we’re a
mature country. Our industries, if you will, have already developed to the point where, if
they are viable, they should be able to stand on their…on their feet. New industries
which are at the frontier don’t…don’t face international competition from those who are
more advanced than they are. So the infant industry argument, in my view, has
some…there is some merit to that in the case of developing economies. But, in fact, what
some of our industries want are protection while they’re senescent or…or in their old age

<!-- Page 11 -->

rather than while they’re infants, and I don’t think there is as a good argument in support
of those kinds of industries.”
FRANK STASIO: As Lawrence has said, advanced countries would be better off
adjusting to shifts in comparative advantage, allowing resources to shift from older, less
efficient industries to more productive pursuits, but as we have seen, there can be serious
political obstacles to free trade. Lawrence says the amount of resistance to structural
change is determined, in part, by the rate of change and the ability of the economy to
absorb displaced workers.
ROBERT LAWRENCE: “If structural change occurs gradually, you see, then, it will
have much less pain, because instead of firing existing workers, basically, it’s possible
for industries and firms to shrink just through voluntary attrition. The fact that people
retire, the fact that people voluntarily leave jobs means that the society can accomplish
quite a lot of structural change without any dislocation at all. That’s one part of it, is the
rate of the structural change. But, perhaps even more significant is what’s going on more
broadly in the overall economy. What we find is that structural change is very difficult to
accomplish in an economy which is growing slowly. When workers are displaced in a
slow-growing economy, they don’t have other opportunities, and therefore, they tend to
resist the structural change and becomes very power…and it becomes much more
painful, and I think, in fact, that that’s why structural changes become more difficulty
over the last decade in the United States. It’s not actually, if you look at objective
measures that we increase the amount of structural change that we’ve actually had in the
economy. It’s simply that the overall growth rate has slowed down, and therefore, it’s
become more difficult to accomplish our structural change. We actually had much more
structural change in the 1950s, indeed, when we were moving large numbers of people
off farms and into northern cities, than we did in the nineteen seventies and early nineteen
eighties, But in the eighties, growth was much…growth was much slower.”
FRANK STASIO: For Lawrence and other economists, trade is best left free of artificial
barriers because short-term cost of adjusting to changes in trade patterns would be
outweighed by the long run benefits to society as a whole. Now, let’s look back at some
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 12 -->

of the key ideas in our discussion about trade. International trade allows countries to
specialize and increase their standard of living. When one country can produce a product
more efficiently than another, it’s said to have an absolute advantage over the other
country in those goods. However, specialization in trade even occur when a country has
only a comparative advantage. Comparative advantage exists when it is more profitable
for a country to specialize in the production of goods with relatively higher value, and
import those of relatively less value. Trade may benefit a country even if the country has
an absolute advantage in the production of high- and low-value products. Economists
like trade to take place free of artificial barriers because they believe free trade leads to
the most efficient use of resources, and lower prices for consumers. But free trade can be
politically difficult to support when foreign competition threatens to force workers in
some industries out of jobs. Resistance to structural changes, caused the influx of
cheaper imports, is determined by how fast the change takes place and the ability of the
economy to absorb displaced workers. There are many kinds of trade barriers. The most
common are quotas which set a limit on the number of units a manufacturer may bring
into the country, and tariffs which tax imports to offset the price advantage they enjoy
over domestic products. In general, economists believe that, in the long run, barrier-free
international trade benefits all trading nations and their people.
