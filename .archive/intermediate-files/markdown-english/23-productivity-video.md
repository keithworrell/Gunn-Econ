DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Throughout most of the 20th century, America enjoyed the
highest rate of productivity growth in the industrial world. But by the late 1970’s,
something was drastically wrong. What was happening to American productivity?
By 1981, the nation was ready to try a new approach…Can less government lead to more
productivity? There is general agreement that new technologies increase productivity,
but is there an extra return to society that makes the government’s investment
worthwhile?
Productivity is a crucial element of our nation’s economic growth. Yet, it is an almost
invisible element in our economic wellbeing, something we take for granted until it
begins to slow down. But that hasn’t happened in the 21st century. To the contrary,
American productivity has increased. Productivity: How do we produce more with the
same or fewer resources? With the help of economic analyst Richard Gill and Nariman
Behravesh, we’ll examine that question on this 21st- century edition of Economics U$A
I’m David Schoumacher.

# Part I

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Economists see the world in terms of supply and
demand…with, simply, demand as the appetite to consume…supply as the ability to
produce. It is productivity that holds the supply side together. As long as productivity
continues to improve, our standard of living continues to improve. This is the classic
widget factory. These workers are building a machine to put the stick in a stick
deodorant tube. If it works, we’ll have more deodorant and less sweat…that is, fewer
hours of work putting the tubes together. That’s productivity for you.
American productivity has been one of the economic marvels of the industrial age. But,
by the late 1970s, our rate of productivity growth had slumped alarmingly. Why did
productivity grow so fast for so long and then suddenly decline in the 1970s? At the
beginning of the 19th century, America was predominantly a farm economy…our
buildings were made of brick and wood. By the year 1900, we were a nation of steel.
Vast deposits of iron and coal fed the blast furnaces of Pittsburgh. Immigrants poured in
from Europe to work in the steel mills…to be part of an industrial miracle that was
creating a better life for American workers. Rapid productivity growth led to an ever
improving standard of living…and the miracle was not just confined to the steel industry.
Throughout the economy, American workers were the most productive in the world.
What was responsible for this phenomenal explosion of productivity? Economist Edward
### Denison singles out one factor as paramount…

EDWARD F. DENISON: “Much the most important is the advances in knowledge of
how to produce at low cost. This includes both technological knowledge and what you’d
call managerial or organizational knowledge…how to run a business, organize it. And
actually, over a long period, like 1929 to ‘82 actually, this accounts for almost 2/3 of the
total increase.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In agriculture, advances in knowledge led to new seeds,
machinery and chemicals…and more crops from fewer workers. Displaced farm workers

migrated to the cities to more productive jobs in the factories and steel mills of industrial
America. Throughout the 1950s and ‘60s, productivity soared. But by the 1970s,
something was drastically wrong. Throughout the economy, productivity growth was
slowing down. The reasons were not immediately clear, but, in retrospect, several factors
stand out. The beginning of the 1970s brought a new era of concern about the
environment. Regulations aimed at cleaning up pollution had an immediate and costly
impact on American industry. Bethlehem Steel president, Walter Williams…
WALTER WILLIAMS: “We spent, if I remember the numbers correctly, in the
equivalent of 1980 dollars, almost a billion dollars in the previous 15 years on
environmental facilities. Now that meant that that money was not available for
modernization projects.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Government regulations forced industry to spend billions
cleaning up the environment and protecting the safety of its workers…and millions of
these workers were new to the jobs…baby boomers eager to work, but still young and
untrained. Their inexperience led to lower output per hour of work…less productivity.
In 1973, war in the Mid East led to an embargo of oil from the Persian Gulf. Energy
prices soared. Productivity growth took a nosedive. And throughout the 1970s, an
economy reeling from spiraling energy costs saw all its other costs rising, too. Inflation
seemed to be an incurable cancer eating away at the American economy…creating a
climate of economic fear and uncertainty…discouraging the capital investment that might
have improved an increasingly dismal productivity performance. If many different
factors had been responsible for the growth of American productivity, it seemed that an
equal diversity of factors was conspiring to retard that growth. Productivity performance
during the 1970s dropped to less than half the rate of the previous half century…and
productivity expert Edward Denison was not encouraging about the prospects for an
“easy cure.”
EDWARD DENISON: “I think the most important thing to recognize is that no one
thing is going to make an enormous difference. And I once was given the task of trying

<!-- Page 5 -->

to find some “quick fix” for the growth rate…and my conclusion was it takes an
enormous amount of doing to get even a tenth of a point addition.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Productivity is an illusive concept. You’ll find the tale of a
kingdom lost for want of a nail in poetry, not in economics. Just as there were many
factors that contributed to the phenomenal growth of American productivity, so there
were many factors that contributed to the decline in growth in the 1970s…factors that
resist “quick and easy” solutions. We asked economic analyst Richard Gill to comment
on the long-range significance of productivity growth and the factors that might cause it
to decline.
(MUSIC PLAYS – COMMENT & ANALYSIS I appears on screen)
(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: Many people fail to understand the true significance of productivity
growth because the numbers we use to express it…one or two percent a year…seem very
small. The first thing to realize is that these “small” numbers involve really huge changes
in output per capita and living standards over long periods of time. Our historic rate of
productivity increase, of between one and one half percent and two percent a year, has
meant a fivefold increase in our real incomes over the past century. So productivity
growth is important and any decline in it is necessarily a matter for concern. But was the
decline we observed in the 1970s a permanent one or merely temporary? There certainly
were many special factors at work during the 1970s. The oil shocks made energy inputs
suddenly much more expensive; rapid inflation increased economic uncertainty; the
composition of the labor force, with many young and inexperienced new entrants, was
changing; and so on. On the other hand, certain factors…for example, government
regulations to protect the environment…may be with us for some time to come. Nor do
we know that the 1970s bout with high inflation will be our last, or for that matter, what
new supply shocks may hit us in the years ahead. Whatever the future, the experience of
the 1970s strongly suggested that productivity growth was something we could no longer
take for granted. Was there anything we could do to improve it?

# Part Ii

RONALD REAGAN: “We have the highest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and
equipment of any of the industrial nations. I stood in Ohio in a great empty shell of a
building that was once a steel plant. The weeds are beginning to grow up, closed because
they could not afford to modernize. And punitive taxes and those excessive regulations
mandating additional costs on them had been responsible.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Ronald Reagan promised to get the government off the
backs of the American people. He argued that less government would give us greater
productivity. The keystone of his play was a $750 billion tax cut. In 1981, the crucial
question was: How could we get more productivity with less taxation? The 1970s had
been difficult years for America…for the people, for the government, even for
economists. By 1980, a growing number of people saw the government as the source, not
the solution, of economic miseries. A new group of economists began to say, “Let’s
unshackle private enterprise…let’s get the government out of the marketplace…let’s give
the people an incentive to produce.” These economists were called “supply siders” and
their spokesman was Arthur Laffer.
ARTHUR LAFFER: “People don’t work to pay taxes…People work to get what they
can after taxes. People don’t increase the productivity of their capital or their labor or
their production processes to give the money away to the government…They do it to
make more profits themselves. And when you cut the taxes, you increase their incentives
for doing that activity…They’ll increase productivity output and employment. Who
cares about productivity when you don’t get any benefits from it? And frankly, people
don’t work for nothing…they work to get paid and when you increase the amount they
get after tax…you’ll find them doing more of it.”

<!-- Page 7 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Laffer believed that tax cuts would cause people to work
harder…Economist Norman Ture argued that the result would be increased savings…
NORMAN TURE: “Every dollar of additional savings represents an additional dollar of
capital of some sort. It is a fundamental law of economics…which to my knowledge has
not been repealed either by John Maynard Keynes or the United States Congress…that
the most effective way of increasing the productivity of labor is by increasing the
quantity and the quality of the capital with which it is employed.”
RONALD REAGAN: “We move on to the individual…you and me…and my proposal is
for a 10 percent cut in the income tax across the board, not a special cut for someone
while someone else…you know, rob Peter and pay Paul…we’re all named Peter today.
10 percent …a 10 percent in 1982, and another 10 percent in 1983…a 30 percent cut over
a three year period.”
### DAVID SCHOUMACHER: But mainstream economists like Nariman Behravesh

remain sharply critical of Reagan’s “supply side” tax proposal…
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: “I think the issue was that most people believed that there
was some impact of reducing marginal tax rates on work effort and savings…but most
analyses suggest that that impact was very small…in fact, so small that it would not have
the kind of “supply side” effect that was being talked about by people like Art Laffer.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The American people were ready for a change. Ronald
Reagan swept to victory in the November election…but his battles had only begun.
Democrats in the House of Representatives were determined to block the new President’s
tax plan. But, as Reagan prepared to take his program to Congress, he found some new
friends along the way…and some new ideas for his tax package. Congressman Barber
Conable added a carrot for business in the form of faster depreciation of capital
investment.

<!-- Page 8 -->

BARBER CONABLE: “The basic Reagan idea was to have a simple proposal of two
parts…rate cuts, and cuts for business that would be given in such a way that would
encourage investments and therefore improve productivity. And the ACRS 1053 Jones
Conable Bill was the second half of the proposal. I felt it was very necessary, in short, to
encourage productivity growth…to encourage savings. I am not a Keynesian. I don’t
believe that you can handle economic policies solely by taking those steps that will
stimulate consumption. I think you’ve got to give some incentives to savings too.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: For months, Reagan, Conable, and the Republicans
hammered away at the Democrats in Congress, trying to pry loose enough votes to pass
the tax package. But the opposition held…the Reagan program was going nowhere. The
tax bill was amended…then amended again in an effort to attract more votes. Then, the
President took his case directly to the people.
RONALD REAGAN: “This is absolutely essential…if we’re to provide incentives and
make capital available for the increased productivity required to provide real permanent
jobs for our people.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: When the votes were counted, the President had muscled
through a great political victory. But was it an economic victory as well? Did the tax cut
increase productivity?
ARTHUR LAFFER: “Yes, clearly, it not only led to better productivity…It also led to
an increase in employment. See, to increase output and employment production in the
system, there are two ways of doing it. One is productivity, which means you get more
for each worker, and the other is to increase the number of workers. And what you found
happening is…both went up. We not only got a lot more employment…we also got a lot
more productivity per employee, which is just the perfect combination.”
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: “I think, by all estimates, it really did not succeed terribly
well. Part of it is that it was swamped out…the “supply side” effects were really
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 9 -->

swamped out by all the demand effects…in other words, the boosts in consumption that
occurred and the boost in investment spending. The one “supply side” effect that did
come through was that the ’81 tax cut did provide very generous benefits to businesses
for investment purposes, and this did boost investment, which in a very traditional,
Keynesian way, led to a higher capital stock…led to increased productivity in the long
run.”
ARTHUR LAFFER: “You can call it anything you want…the question is…it works.
Now, those of us in sort of the academic garb who like to get into the footnotes and argue
there…sure, you can say, was it a demand shift or was it a supply shift? Who cares?
Production output…employment… increased enormously. Now I think it was a supply
shift…”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: 1981 was a bad year for the economy. 1982 was even
worse. But 1983 was a boom year…a year that saw many of President Reagan’s
economic predictions come true. To many it seemed we really had improved
productivity by cutting taxes…Workers and businesses alike were working harder and
investing more. But to the economics community as a whole, the relationship was by no
means that simple. We asked Richard to summarize. How does a tax cut stimulate
productivity?
(MUSIC PLAYS – COMMENT & ANALYSIS II appears on screen)
(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
RICHARD GILL: The ways in which lowered taxes can improve productivity are fairly
obvious. Higher take home pay may encourage workers to work harder and more
efficiently. Lower taxes may provide businesses with more funds for investment and
greater incentives to take the risks of introducing new technologies. The real issue is:
How large are these effects? Take the Reagan tax cuts of the early 1980’s. The supply
side enthusiasts argued that lower tax rates would lead to much higher productivity,
which would lead to a greatly increased GNP, and that this greater GNP would actually

<!-- Page 10 -->

result in higher total government tax revenues, even at the lower rates. In short, we’d get
such spectacular increases in productivity and growth that we wouldn’t even have to
think about government deficits! The less enthusiastic view was that lower tax rates
would indeed lead to big budget deficits, that government borrowing would lead to high
interest rates and that this would result in lower business investment and growth.
Obviously, the effects of the Reagan tax cuts are very complicated…and many of these
effects are still with us. If we simply compare the two years, 1981 and 1984 we can say:
yes, productivity did increase; yes, there was growth; yes, in fact, total federal tax
revenues did increase slightly. But also yes, there were huge budget deficits and yes, real
interest rates stayed at damagingly high levels. Perhaps, on one point both sides might
agree: If you’re going in for massive tax cuts to spur productivity growth, it would
probably also be at least prudent to do something to keep the government spending side
of the equation in check.
# Part Iii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The Internet -- linked to satellites, combined with software,
operated by computers and smart phones – the Information Age is upon us.
Transforming technological innovations allow us to be more productive personally and in
all varieties of occupations and industries. It appears to be a national addiction.
MARK DOMS: “The idea of waiting around just doesn’t happen as much today…
And for businesses, that’s just really important…They are just able to be productive all
the time.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The benefits of technological innovation are not confined to
the innovators or firms that financed the innovation but to society as a whole.
MARK DOMS: “I wish more people would go back into a time machine when it was
back in the early ‘90’s, back before the Internet and communication technology, when
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 11 -->

landline phones were still kind of all the rage. You know, life was much more difficult,
communicating with people was a real hassle.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: After years of being stalled, productivity growth in the
United States was kick started in 1995 when the technology industry began to boom.
Robotics revolutionized the automobile industry. Big box retailers put barcodes and
inventory tracking to productive use. Banks made use of electronic banking and ATMs
to streamline their business. Telephone and telecom businesses, automating many
services, also had huge increases in productivity.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The federal government has long recognized the spillover
effect of technological innovations, that is, the extra return to society from research and
development investments made to develop new products. But research and development
can be costly and time consuming. Is it then appropriate for the federal government to
invest in research and development?
MARK DOMS: “If you look, then, within the non defense portion of R&D you see a lot
of money is spent by the National Institutes of Health, and a lot of that is for basic
biological research, and the thinking there is that if we better understand the human
genome, if we better understand how cells work, then the NIH spends a lot of money on
these very basic principles, which will then help us propel new medical discoveries…
So that is a clear example of where if we think we do this basic research we will have a
better understanding of how things work, then that will be a good platform for other
inventions to occur.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The classic examples of platforms that the government
nurtured were satellites and the Internet. Government support has resulted in the
flowering of thousands of offshoots. Take for example, weather forecasting.
BOB RYAN: “Some of the early experiments -- there’s a great story -- in the numerical
weather forecasting process were done in the ‘50s where it took about two or three days

<!-- Page 12 -->

of computer time to generate a 24-hour forecast. So the great increase in computer power
has allowed us to ingest much much more information and data and then generate a
forecast... information in a very timely manner and also make it then that much smaller
scale. And also very accurately now…days…five, six, even seven days in advance,
something we couldn’t do twenty, thirty years ago.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Technological innovation has increased the productivity of
weather forecasters and has made weather information readily available, increasing our
productivity as well.
BOB RYAN: “Now we have also a variety of tools where we can put these onto… our
home page, onto our website, so somebody that says, ‘I only want to see the winds,’ well,
here’s a graphic. You can see the winds. You can see what the temperatures would be at
eight, nine, ten o’clock tomorrow.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Never was this ability to make accurate weather predictions
more pronounced than in the winters of 1993 and 1996.
BOB RYAN: “Back in the 90s, when a lot of these very accurate local numerical
simulations were coming on, I was able to see the potential for this big, big snow event.
And I remember communicating and telling people, ‘wherever you are tomorrow, plan on
being there for a long time.’ ”
MARK DOMS: “This is an example of weather, but more in general what we are talking
about is, you’re able to get information that you need to make the right decisions…
It is very easy, it’s very cheap, to get information, and lots of companies are basically
trying to customize this information to you. We’re just flooded with information now
because of all of this information technology, and now I think we are beginning to use
that information better, and it makes us more productive.”

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: There is no more often sighted example of government’s
contribution to America’s productivity gain than that represented by its investment in
space and satellite communication. But would this increase have occurred anyway,
without government research and funding? We asked Nariman Behravesh to comment.
(MUSIC PLAYS – COMMENT & ANALYSIS II appears on screen)
(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: Technological innovation has been a major factor in the
growth of productivity in the United States. The development of new products and
processes allow people to do what they were doing before, using less time, and—just as
important—to do what they never dreamed of doing before. There is a catch, however.
Since the benefits of innovation do not accrue only to the person or company that
developed the new technology, but are often enjoyed by society as a whole, there can be a
disincentive to the developer. Specifically, others can use or exploit the innovation
without compensating the innovator. Economists classify this type of technology
spillover as a positive externality.
Unfortunately, given the disincentives associated with such spillovers, the free market,
left to its own devices, will encourage less innovation than is socially desirable. To
remedy this problem, the government can “internalize the externality” in multiple ways:
by sponsoring research and development at one of the many government-run labs, by
giving subsidies for private sector R&D, and by strengthening patent protection.
There are lots of examples of government-sponsored technologies transforming our lives.
The NASA moon program spurred the development of the all-pervasive microchip. The
Department of Defense’s DARPA Net was eventually transformed into the Internet. And
the Global Positioning System—GPS—developed for the military, has made it easier for
all of us to find our way around.

<!-- Page 14 -->

These success stories have led some economists to advocate for an even bigger
involvement of the government in innovation. Other economists are more skeptical of
this type of industrial policy. They worry that the government is not in the best position
to pick technology winners, and that the process can become highly politicized. They
advocate, instead, for greater use of the patent protection system, which gives inventors a
temporary monopoly on new technologies.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In the last few decades, American productivity has shot up.
Whether it came though the necessity of competition, the creation of new technologies,
or government funded research and development, one thing remains clear. Increased
productivity will always be the life blood of the American economy. For this 21st-
Century Edition of Economics U$A, I’m David Schoumacher.
