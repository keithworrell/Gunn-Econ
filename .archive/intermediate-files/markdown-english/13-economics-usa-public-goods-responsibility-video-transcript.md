DAVID SCHOUMACHER: It was 1927. Once again havoc reigned throughout the
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. In the midst of a Great Depression, Congress created
the TVA…a federal project to control the ravages of the great Tennessee River. Why
would anyone object? Medical advances have added years to the lives of
Americans…but not everyone can afford the high cost of today’s medical care. So why
shouldn’t the government guarantee a minimum level of health care? And following the
attack of 9/11, was the Fed’s takeover of airport security justified?
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: We don’t all agree on the proper role and desirable size of
government. Some feel government has gotten out of hand, while others feel we’re not
doing enough in the right places. Public Goods and Responsibility: How Far Should We
Go? We’ll examine that question with the help of economic analysts Nariman Behravesh
and Richard Gill on this 21st century edition of Economics U$A. I’m David
Schoumacher.

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: We can all enjoy the benefits of public services such as
museums, schools, and highways, but somehow they have to be paid for. And they

are…most often in the form of taxes. One of the central questions about these services is
why the government must provide them. Why can’t we rely instead on the free market?
It’s a controversial question, as we see in the case of private utilities versus the TVA.
The great Mississippi flood of 1927 left 800,000 homeless as the swelling waters overran
levies throughout the Tennessee River and into the Mississippi. Thousands of acres of
farmland were damaged, turning northern Louisiana into an inland sea. Secretary of
Commerce, Herbert Hoover, called the flood the greatest peacetime calamity in the
history of the country. The disaster was predictable. The Mississippi had flooded before.
Local authorities attempted to provide flood control, but their efforts were uneven and the
levy system is only as strong as its weakest link. A technical solution, the building of
dams, could have prevented the flood. In the absence of initiatives from the private
sector, some legislators felt that federal funds ought to be used. But they faced tough
opposition on Capitol Hill. Dams not only control floods, but they can be used to
generate large amounts of hydro-electric power…and that presented a threat of
competition to the private utilities.
ALVIN VOGTLE: “To justify the heavy expenditure of money required to build all
these dams, there had to be something else like the sale of electricity…and that would be
produced by these hydro-electric units which were going to be installed in the dams. And
it was that feature which caught the eye of the people who opposed TVA because they
thought that was a function the government ought not to engage in.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The private utilities were successful in their opposition until
1933 when a new administration, with an activist view of the role of government, came
into power. Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the Tennessee Valley Authority…the
TVA. William Jennings Randolph was a member of Congress during the Roosevelt
Administration.
WILLIAM JENNINGS RANDOLPH: “The Tennessee Valley Authority was a product
of the so-called ‘New Deal.’ It was a long-range program…It was not doling out some

money here and there…It was the planning of an area in the United States of America
where there would be a development. Of course…hydro-electric power…that was a part
of it.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The plan to provide economic development to the
Appalachian region began with the construction of the Norris Dam on the Klinch River.
The TVA plan was ambitious. The regional economies could be improved if the waters
were made navigable and goods could flow all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. The TVA
constructed housing, began a malaria control project, worked on agricultural development
and provided electrical power to this depressed region. Some thought the government
was now going too far. Along with the utilities, others who feared economic loss joined
in the opposition. Coal miners feared the TVA’s generation of hydro-electric power
would cut into the demand for coal.
WILLIAM JENNINGS RANDOLPH: “I remember when the coal operators and the coal
miners of West Virginia came to Washington, D.C. And they were very angry at me
because I was an open supporter of the legislation to create the Tennessee Valley
Authority. And they said, ‘This will rob us of hundreds and thousands of jobs if this is
done over a wide area, turning these rivers into lakes and productive areas for the power
systems. That will not stop in the Tennessee Valley Authority,’ they said, ‘but will go
out into other regions of the United States.’ So they looked upon it as something that
they must oppose…And they did so, vigorously.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The TVA argued that flood control was its primary
goal…and the revenues from energy sales only assisted in financing the dams. The
opposition argued that the government had no right being in the power business. Within
5 years some 57 suits were brought against the TVA. Finally, in 1937, the legal issues
were resolved. The U.S. District Court upheld the TVA, ruling that the projects were
primarily for the improvements of navigation and flood control. The legal case was over,
but the political issues lingered. On one hand, TVA had harnessed the great flood waters
of the valley, spurring other economic activity in this once deeply depressed region. On

the other hand, utility companies continued to claim that the TVA was an element of
“creeping socialism”. We asked economic analyst Richard Gill: How do economists
determine the extent of government involvement in a free-market society?

## (Music Plays - Comment And Analysis I)

RICHARD GILL: As far back as Adam Smith in the 18th century, even economists
devoted to the principle of a private market economy have recognized that there are
certain areas that virtually require government intervention. Put crudely, if Uncle Sam
won’t do it, no one else will. The TVA project of the 1930s had many different aspects
but, in one respect, it clearly met this test. It provided what economists call a public
good…A good that has to be provided collectively or not at all. I am speaking here of the
flood control and navigation improvements made possible by the TVA dams. These
improvements were in the interests of society, but they would not have been in the
interests of private individuals or businesses. Why? Well, for one thing, the benefit of
flood and navigation control was spread over the entire region and not limited to a few
paying customers. Flood control protects me and my neighbor and thousands of others in
the region and, for that matter, thousands more who may move in after the dams are built.
This is a general indivisible benefit and, whether it is enjoyed by a thousand or a million
people, the cost of providing it is unchanged. And the real problem with a public good
like this is that it is impossible, or certainly extremely difficult, to charge any private
consumer for the benefit he is receiving. My neighbor decides to pay for flood control,
but I do not. There is basically no way in which I can be excluded from the benefit of his
flood control. Just as there is no way in which I can be excluded from the benefits of,
say, a nationwide polio vaccine program, or…the most obvious case of a public
good…national defense. Invasions of flood waters, contagious diseases or foreign armies
can rally be handled only in one way: collectively. Public goods provide one clear
reason for government intervention in the economy…a point on which virtually all
economists can agree!

# Part Ii

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Our country has accepted the need for the government to
provide public goods like dams or traffic lights, local police and national defense, but that
by no means covers all questions of government involvement in our lives. What, for
example, are the responsibilities of government to people who can’t afford necessities
like decent housing or food…or the subject of this investigation, health care?
Health care costs have risen astronomically over the past few decades. Most of us cope
with the high cost of medical care through insurance…a way of sharing the risk of high
medical bills. But not everyone has medical insurance. Those without it face being
turned away from emergency rooms or being dumped to public hospitals many miles
away. It is no secret that low income people go without adequate medical services and
have a shorter life expectancy as a result. Health care used to be within one’s means.
But, in the 1940s, health care costs became more expensive as medical technology
advanced and grew more specialized. In the process, the cost of medical care went
beyond the means of most families. The marketplace offered one solution…private
insurance coverage under the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Programs. By the end of World
War II, only half of the population was protected by some form of hospital insurance.
But many, particularly the aged, the poor and those without jobs, had no coverage at all.
In 1946, President Harry S. Truman called for national health insurance to cover all
Americans. But his program didn’t make it through Congress. Its passage was blocked
by the American Medical Association. AMA President, Dr. James Sammons…
JAMES H. SAMMONS: “I think the AMA’s opposition was in great part
responsible for helping defeat the Truman plan and some other plans that have come
down the line. If the doctors of this country had agreed with those plans, I think they
would now be in place. On any national health insurance program that is proposed, the
AMA is going to have the same objections that we’ve had all along. It does interfere in
the doctor/patient relationship…It does not guarantee quality of care…It is a form of
rationing…It would be incredibly expensive if it were attempted on a national basis…and
there is not a need for it in this country.”

HENRY AARON: “Well, that question’s one that’s been debated long and hard and I
really think the evidence and the arguments on behalf of the government role are
overwhelming. They range from the fact that for a variety of reasons we have decided, in
all developed societies, that at the time people become ill we are not going to require
them to pay for the full cost of the services that they receive at that very time.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: As the costs of medical care grew, more and more favored
some kind of government action. Wilbur Cohen, former Undersecretary HEW…
WILBUR COHEN: “In 1950, when I was the Director of Research and Statistics for
Social Security, the Federal Security Administrator asked me if I had an idea as to how to
get out of the inactivity we were in, and I said, ‘Yes, I had an idea…Instead of covering
everybody, why not cover just the aged who were receiving Social Security?’ He thought
that was a good idea and he asked me to draft the Bill, so, in 1950-51, I drafted that sort
of a Bill for him and it was introduced in Congress in 1951, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1959,
1960…But in 1959 I persuaded Senator John f. Kennedy to be for the idea and that’s
what changed the whole situation. Kennedy and Johnson, in the campaign of 1960, came
out for Medicare…Kennedy appointed me the Assistant Secretary of HEW to get the Bill
through Congress…I spent 5 years doing that.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Finally, in 1965, during the Great Society era, Medicare, an
insurance program for those 65 and older, and Medicaid, a joint federal-state health
program for the poor, were passed. President Lyndon Johnson flew out to Independence,
Missouri, and, in the presence of Harry S. Truman, signed the Bill into law. Many were
aided by these programs. Medicaid covered the health care costs of millions of low
income people. We asked Henry Aaron if that met our responsibilities to those who
couldn’t afford medical care.
HENRY AARON: “This wouldn’t be a problem if all states provided benefits as
generous as those in, say, the upper third or upper half of the distribution. Some states in
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 8 -->

the United States, however, provide extremely meager Medicaid benefits…fewer than ten
days a year of hospitalization, severe limits on the number of doctor’s visits one can
receive, a narrow range of services covered…so that even moderate illnesses may not be
fully protected under the Medicaid Program. In addition to which, the population that
may be served by the Medicaid Program in many states is really quite narrowly defined.
So notwithstanding the fact that Medicaid is the federal health program for the poor,
millions of poor Americans, in fact, are not covered by Medicaid benefits and, in fact, are
not covered by any benefits of any type at all. They don’t have government protection…
They don’t have private insurance because they have been out of work or because they
work in types of jobs that do not provide such coverage…and the result is that on the
order of 15 to 20% of the American population at the present time has little or no health
insurance protection, either through private insurance or through government programs.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In the 1970s, the cost of Medicare and Medicaid mounted.
As the burdens on state governments increased, the programs ran into criticism from state
### Governors like Ronald Reagan…

RONALD REAGAN: “We find that Medi-Cal, as we call our Medicaid Program in
California, is increasing by 50% a year. In its first sixteen months it was budgeted for
746 million dollars…But 876 million dollars were spent, meaning that this program went
130 million dollars in debt in that limited time. And we’ve been informed that debt has
to be paid off out of this year’s working budget. We’re in deep trouble in this phase of
welfare. In California alone, hastily drawn legislation in this field can bankrupt our state
unless we have major revisions.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: In 2010, Congress passed, and President Barack Obama
signed landmark legislation to expand health care benefits, including a provision to
provide care for all Americans. Then in 2011, as the nation faced a budget crisis and
many objected to “individual mandate” provisions, the new Health Care Reform Act
reignited a firestorm of controversy. We asked economist Richard Gill if there continues
to be an economic rationale for government subsidized health care.

## (Music Plays - Comment And Analysis Ii)

RICHARD GILL: The fundamental argument for government subsidized health care for
the elderly, and especially for the poor, is that a market economy doesn’t distribute
income in the way most people consider fair and desirable. Mind you, a market economy
does have its own principle of income distribution, and it isn’t an insignificant one. Very
generally, a market economy pays people more...the more economically productive they
are. This isn’t a trivial principle: It probably does keep the productive process running
rather smoothly and this ultimately provides more abundance for all of us. However, a
lot of people can get left out in this process and the instance of people who are both poor
and ill is a clear case in point. When a poor person gets seriously ill, his already low
productivity suffers a severe blow while, at the same time, his need for support mounts
sharply…often catastrophically, in fact, given today’s monumental medical costs! What
the Medicaid Program says, in effect, is that this burden is too great for any individual to
bear by himself. The market may have a just appreciation of abilities but it doesn’t have
a just appreciation of needs. Society has to step in. Of course, there is always some cost
to this. When you start redistributing income, you are increasing tax burdens on the
economically more productive groups in the economy. Also, Medicare and Medicaid
Programs do have a tendency to up medical costs generally. As in so many economic
issues, the question isn’t “whether,” but “how much?” A question not infrequently raised
during the past decade.

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: Until 2001, security on planes and in airports was handled
by airport managers and airline companies. Passengers moved swiftly from ticket lines to
airplane seats. There were times when tighter security measures became necessary. But
soon air travel returned to normal. Then came 9/11 and everything changed. Why did the
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 10 -->

federal government decide it was time to take airport security away from the private
sector?
Not too many years ago, you could show up without a reservation, buy a ticket at the
airline counter, check your bags and walk onto a plane. Then on the morning of
September 11, 2001, nineteen terrorists breached security checkpoints and boarded four
commercial airlines. Within hours, two planes crashed into New York’s World Trade
Center. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon. The events of 9/11 were a wake-up
call for a much-needed check-up on America's airline security. The question was: can
airport security be left in the hands of the airlines?
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: “The present situation is not acceptable. The people who now
do these jobs are underpaid and ill trained. At least partial federalization, at least the top
140 airports in America should have federal employees carrying out these very vital
functions of insuring security at airports.”
SEN. JOHN KERRY: “We need to have a system that has a national standard with
national employees, not unlike a border patrol or customs.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The discussion continued in the halls of congress for
another two months…
REP. LEE TERRY: “”Until now, airlines have been in charge of security at our airports.
They, in turn, for the lowest bid …hire companies…”
REP. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES: “We need to enact legislation that will federalize
the airline security personnel. …”

<!-- Page 11 -->

SEN. JAY ROCKEFELLER: “Law enforcement has to be fulfilled by the federal
government. Everybody agrees on that…”
REP. JACK KINGSTON: “The issue is protecting my children, my family, my loved
ones, and your business associates and loved ones, when they travel.”
DAVID SHOUMACHER: The economic debate over government’s takeover of airline
security was not as one-sided as the political debate. Was security a public or private
good? Congress seemed to be saying it was a public good.
PETER VAN DOREN: “There are two features of goods – the ability to restrict
consumption to those who pay for them, and whether consumption is rivalrous or not.
Private goods are, you can restrict consumption to those who pay, and consumption of the
good is rivalrous and here’s where we go to the airlines. Should airlines provide their
own security, then the question is: are they pure public goods? i.e., you can’t restrict
consumption to those who pay, and consumption is not rivalrous.”
ALICE RIVLIN: “ I would consider airport security a public good. It’s protecting the
public that flies and the public that’s in buildings or wherever…that might be flown into.
Clearly we have an interest in not having another 9/11 or 9/11-like incident.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: With the passage of the Aviation and Transportation
Security Act, competition between airlines over security was ended.
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: “The events of September the 11th were a call to
action and the congress has now responded. The law I will sign should give all
Americans greater confidence when they fly. For the first time airport security will be a
direct federal responsibility.”

<!-- Page 12 -->

DAVID SCHOUMACHER: The federal government spent millions to improve airline
security. Cockpit doors were reinforced… armed undercover officers were placed on
passenger flights. Many carry on items were banned, and checked baggage started
flowing through an explosives detection system.
Not only would the federal government pay for increased security, they would also
provide it through the transportation security administration. Airport security personnel
more than doubled. This massive overhaul forever changed air travel. No longer can a
passenger show up 10 minutes before take off and walk on a plane.
### How is it working for passengers?

PASSENGER 1: “It’s the age we’re in now and not that we like it, but we have to live
with it.”
PASSENGER 2: “It’s kind of annoying, but if it’s for the safety of the aircraft, I’m for
it.”
PASSENGER 3: “Probably don’t mind taking my shoes off, I think the machines and all,
seems like it’s getting a bit beyond where I’m comfortable.”
PASSENGER 4: “I have no problem taking my shoes off, taking my belt off, giving
them my cell phone and letting them see it all.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: When full body scanners were introduced, the issue of who
should provide airline security was again in the news. Would the private sector do a
better job, for less?
PETER WALLISON: “If we turn it back to private enterprise, there could be a concern
that the airlines would be more interested in getting the passengers through security
quickly, than making sure that those passengers are fully vetted in the security process,
and if you look at it in terms of which would be better overall for travelers, and for the
airlines I think the answer would have to be on balance the government should probably

be doing that.”
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: What we go through in the name of security when we board
a plane is inconvenient and occasionally invasive. But convenience and privacy are no
longer the driving forces in deciding who is responsible for keeping us safe when we fly.
We asked Nariman Behravesh to explain why.
(ECONOMICS U$A LOGO appears on screen)
## (Music Plays - Comment And Analysis Ii)

NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: Economists classify a good as a public good if it satisfies
two conditions. First in the jargon of economics, is it non-excludable? That is a good or
service for which people who are not paying for it can still use it. Second, in the jargon
of economics is it non-rival? Does one person’s use of it diminish other people’s use of
it? National defense is a classic example of a public good. Everyone is protected and it
is impossible to prevent any single person from benefiting from that protection.
It is difficult to determine how much a public good is worth to each individual because
they may be able to benefit from it without having to declare how much it is worth to
them. This is called the “free rider problem.” Most economists agree that airline security
is a public good. It benefits everyone jointly and you can’t prevent someone who is not
paying for it from being covered by it. No surprise then, that before 9/11, a lot of people
did not want to pay the extra cost of security and the airlines did not force them to.
Instead the airlines cut costs and, in the process, reduced the effectiveness of security.
Free markets almost always “under-supply” public goods. The solution to correct this
type of “market failure” is to have the government provide the good or service and to tax
people in order to pay for it. While the current system of publicly provided airline
security has been no panacea, the record, in terms of the prevention or more terrorist
attacks speaks for itself.
DAVID SCHOUMACHER: From the time of the founding of this nation, it has been
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 14 -->

recognized that despite the advantages of the free enterprise system, there are certain
goods and services that the market will not provide. So it has generally been accepted
that the government will provide those services. The government’s responsibilities have
evolved, however, pushing beyond the economically well-defined reasons for
government involvement into broader social arenas. How far we should go in this
direction depends on the public’s perception of the needs—of the effectiveness of the
government in serving them—and of course, our willingness to pay. For the 21st-Century
Edition of Economics U$A. I’m David Schoumacher.
