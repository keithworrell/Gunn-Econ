FRANK STASIO: Economics U$A. One of a series of programs designed to explore
twentieth-century micro and macroeconomic principles. The subject of this edition is
The Economics of Environmental Regulation. Our guest is Dr. Joel Schwartz with the
Economic Analysis Division of the Environmental Protection Agency. I’m Frank Stasio.
WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: “The American people put a very high premium on public
health. I think that’s justified, probably higher than anybody in the world, but that does
not mean that we, in my view, that we should pursue public health policies to the
exclusion of everything else.”
FRANK STASIO: Everybody wants to live in a clean and healthy environment. But as
William Ruckelshaus suggested at his Senate confirmation hearings in 1983
environmental regulation is part of a much broader agenda of social wants and needs.
The fact is that keeping our air and water clean doesn’t come cheap as long as we also

demand the convenience and benefits of living in a technological country. Most people
are willing to pay something to keep our air and water from becoming polluted. But how
much should we pay? Is there a point where the cost is too high? And can we put a price
on good health and piece of mind? Can those qualities be compromised? Public
policymakers and environmental experts grapple with these questions every day. The
answers are never perfect but the ways they arrive at their conclusions can underscore
social priorities and provide a rational basis to discuss the environmental cost of doing
business. Dr. Joel Schwartz is with the Economic Analysis Division of the
Environmental Protection Agency. He points out that the costs of keeping the
atmosphere and waterways clean limit our control of pollution.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “You can’t just say control it absolutely because of two reasons.
One, there may not be that much money in the world. And two, because if you look at
tradeoffs between spending money on environment and on other things, um, it may be a
bad deal. For example, it may be that putting more money into getting heart attack
victims to the hospital sooner would lead to a much more important improvement in
health for your dollar than on the margin tightening an environmental standard where it
may not. And that’s why you want to look and see what people are willing to avoid
health risks in general in the economy and measure our environmental regulations against
that.”
FRANK STASIO: Schwartz tries to evaluate those tradeoffs and compare how much it
will cost a certain pollutant to various levels against the benefits of those controls. That
is how much the reductions in pollution will save society as a whole. This kind of study
is called cost benefit analysis.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “There are two basic difficulties, um, for doing a cost benefit study.
One is that costs are pretty easy to measure and benefits are less easy. It’s obvious how
much it costs. They have to put this equipment on the plant. You find out how much
they paid for the equipment. The benefits, you need to know two things that we generally

have a hard time finding out. And one is a dose response function between the pollutant
and the damage it causes whether it’s crop loss or disease or materials damages. At any
given level of the pollutant, how many people are sick? And if you don’t know that, then
it’s hard to estimate the change in the number of people who are sick when you go with
the pollution level and therefore what you’re getting at of a given level of control. And
so it’s hard to do a tradeoff. And then the second thing that’s hard is to try to put a value
on that illness. Um, and there again to the extent we can measure medical costs or
workdays lost we can put a value on that. Putting value on, you know, the suffering and
some of the thing—other things is…is more difficult. And the medical costs are…are
sort of funny because if I have a disease whose treatment is pretty cheap but which is a
serious disease and may have long-term consequences for you, unless I have good
information on those long-term consequences I will value it at the cheap cost of
treatment. If I have a disease that’s relatively mild but the treatment is very extensive,
I’m gonna wind up saying well that one’s worth much more to avoid than the other one.
Whereas the other one may lead to some chronic lung problem which is in fact much
more serious. Um, and so the medical costs for the acute event are not necessarily good
proxies for the long-term, um, medical costs that will be undergone. But usually it’s a lot
easier to find out about acute events than about chronic events as a result of exposure to
air pollution because people move all throughout the country. You know you want to
find out what twenty years of exposure to a given pollution level, you gotta follow
someone for twenty years. And since people move, that’s not easy.”
FRANK STASIO: Dr. Schwartz is an author of one of the most comprehensive cost
benefit studies ever conducted by the EPA. The survey was an attempt to predict the
effect of proposed rules by the EPA to lower lead levels in gasoline. Lead emissions
cause serious health problems especially in children. Lead also does crop and property
damage. The study compared the benefits to society of reducing lead emissions to the
cost of oil refiners and ultimately the public of producing gasoline with lower lead levels.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “First we had to know how much blood lead levels change when
you change the amount of lead in gasoline. And we gathered together four different
epidemiological data sets where we could look at what the correlation was between lead

<!-- Page 5 -->

in gasoline and lead in blood in different places. And we found a very consistent pattern
from which we were able to then estimate how that would vary. Then the next
component would be to say well there are lots of other sources of lead and so you have a
broad distribution of blood lead levels. As you move that distribution to a lower level,
how many fewer people are at the levels where certain effects occur? And the effects that
we looked at were at higher levels in children who are very sensitive to lead. There are
neurological effects. There are disturbances in cognitive functioning. At high blood lead
levels children have been found to have lower IQs, to have shorter attention spans, to…to
learn with greater difficulty, more likely to be left back in school. And so we looked at
those things, and we tried to estimate the number of children. And that’s the first thing.
Because even if you can’t always put dollar values on things, at least if you can
enumerate them in some way, you can see how many of them are happening, that’s
important also because then you’re not making a decision on where to set a standard in a
vacuum; you have some idea.”
FRANK STASIO: The first part of the study was relatively straightforward. Schwartz
was able to get objective information and come to some fairly specific conclusions about
the effect of leaded auto exhaust on human beings. The next step was to try to put a
dollar value on the damage. Here it’s a little tricky.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “It’s difficult to value loss of cognitive functioning. We spend
some time looking at correlations between IQ and earnings as a way of valuing it but we
decided that they were gonna be too controversial to use. And so what we used instead
was studies indicating how much compensatory education for children costs that are
mildly disturbed in cognitive functioning in some way. And there’s data from the
Department of Education at various different levels of that and we found one level that
seemed to match the kinds of things that were happening to these lead exposed children
best. And we used the costs estimates for that kind of, uh, level of intervention which is
basically kids staying in a regular school, regular classroom but going couple of times a
week to the reading teacher or school psychologist or something like that. And so we’ve
used that value. For somewhat lower levels, we use the value of medical care to get rid

<!-- Page 6 -->

of the lead. Um, and we based that on protocols that have been published in the Journal
of Pediatrics on how to take care of kids with these blood lead levels.”
FRANK STASIO: Schwartz also looked at non-medical benefits of controlling lead. like
improved crop yields and lower auto maintenance costs. Meanwhile, the studies showed
the cost of lowering lead levels. Lead is added to gasoline to increase octane levels.
There are other ways to get the same octane but those methods cost more, and the costs
are passed on to consumers at the pump. When the EPA compared the additional cost of
refining gasoline with the benefits of lower lead emissions, the study projected a net
savings to society of more than one point two billion dollars in the first year of the new
regulations. Such analyses can be useful to measure the cost to society called social costs
against the rewards called social benefits.
GEORGE MITCHELL: “It is a rather easy task to place a value upon the cost of control
but a rather difficult task to assign a dollar value to the benefits derived from that control.
We know what it will cost to install a scrubber in a particular utility plant. But what is
the value of human life? “
FRANK STASIO: Maine Senator George Mitchell put that question to William
Ruckelshaus at Ruckelshaus confirmation hearings in 1983. It is perhaps the most
difficult question for environmental policymakers to answer. In fact, regulators don’t
really try to assign a dollar value to human life. Instead they try to measure how much
people will pay to avoid varying degrees of risk.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “Obviously, anyone would pay all the money in the world to save
their life but that’s not what you’re really looking at. What you’re really looking at is a
small change in the risk of having a heart attack in a very large number of people. So for
each individual the risk is small. And people make decisions all the time where they’re
trading something off against small risks. They decide to put seatbelts on in their car, or
not. Um, they decide to take a somewhat riskier job, or they don’t. And you can look at
those sorts of things and try to estimate how much money people are willing to pay for
reductions in risk of dying. And when you look at some of the occupational, um, data
where you can look at riskier occupations and…and what the wages are and try to control

<!-- Page 7 -->

where, you know, unionization and region of the country and things like that. You see
that there are in fact risk premiums that people in riskier occupations do get paid more
money. And if you look at data on how much money people are willing to spend to save
time and you look at whether or not they wear seatbelts, you can come up with an
estimate of how much they value risk at from that too. And all of those things are a little
noisy in that you never know whether the person really knows what the risks are that
they’re trading off or not, and so it’s difficult to…to be really confident in any one of
those studies. But the range of those studies is between is if you translate from value of
risk to value of statistical life, um, in the range a half a million dollars to seven million
dollars per life saved. Um, and there are almost no studies below that and very few
above that. So that’s still a factor of ten range but at least you’ve narrowed it down. Um,
we used a value of a million dollars per statistical life saved.”
FRANK STASIO: Very often firms complain that the cost of controlling pollution is too
high. In their fight to remain free from environmental controls they remind regulators
that the cost of pollution control will be passed onto the consumer. Well that much is
true. But the suggestion that by allowing pollution to go unabated there are no costs is
simply wrong. The social costs of pollution are not immediately apparent because
they’re not added in to the cost of the product. These costs are called externalities of
production.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “If you have a very dirty factory that produces a tremendous
amount of soot and people are dying of respiratory disease, you know the elderly are
more likely to get pneumonia and die and stuff like that because of all the particulates in
the air, that’s a cost of making the product that you make. But you’re not paying that cost
– you don’t pay their medical care, you don’t pay money, um, as you know to their heirs,
they can’t sue you and collect damages because this person died – and therefore some of
the cost of making the product that you make is not being borne by you. And, therefore,
similarly to the case of the subsidy you’re going to make too much of that product
because you’re matching the revenue that you get to only the fraction of the course…cost
that you bear. And pollution is a classic externality. You’re laying the cost off on the
people who are breathing the air and drinking the water and, therefore, you’re not making

the socially optimum decisions in terms of either how much of the product to make or
what technology to use to make it. And if we internalize that cost, if we make the firm
bear that cost, then it will make the right decision in terms of trading off which
technology to use and in terms of how much to make given a given price on the outside.”
FRANK STASIO: There are two ways that regulators can internalize the cost of
pollution. One is to set an industry wide standard and to require each firm in that
industry to meet the standard by a certain time. As an example, all oil refiners had to
reduce lead levels in gasoline from a half a gram to a tenth of a gram per gallon by
Nineteen Eighty-six. Now the other way to achieve that standard would be to impose a
tax on pollution. Using the example of leaded gasoline, the government could charge
refiners for the amount of lead they use.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “If we had a tax, then every individual company could decide how
much lead they were gonna put in their gasoline. Instead of everyone putting in a tenth of
a gram, some would put in less and some would put in a little more and they would do it
in a way that minimized the total cost to society for the same total number of grams of
lead being used because we could adjust the tax rate so the amount of lead would be used
but each individual person would use a slightly different amount in their gas. Also, some
people you know who own Nineteen Sixty-seven GTOs that need high octane gas have a
hard time getting it. Premium unleaded isn’t quite high octane enough and they tend to
mix a little lead in with it to get a little extra boost out of the lead. They might be willing
to pay a lot more money to get a little bit more lead in their gas, and there might be other
people driving cars that can legally use leaded gas that, you know, as long as they can get
eighty-nine octane gas for their car, they don’t really care. They’ll use unleaded. And
when we fit in a regulation, there’s sort of no way for that sort of trading on a micro level
to work its way out. And so it’s less efficient.”
FRANK STASIO: Schwartz details how a tax would lead to more efficient decisions on
the part of refiners.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “If I say, ‘well all leaded gas has to be a tenth of a gram,’ then I
have one refinery, let’s say, that has lots of spare octane equipment that doesn’t sell very

<!-- Page 9 -->

much premium unleaded. It’s got octane coming out of its ears. Um, it could easily run
at a lower lead level. I have another refinery with relatively more leaded gasoline in
there so taking lead out of it will cost them more, and they may have less octane
generating capacity to begin with. Um, the industry as a whole is in surplus. But
obviously everyone doesn’t have the same amount of surplus. It’s going to cost them
more, therefore, because they’re a little tighter. Now if those two refineries could get
together, you could find an optimum combination of lead use at Refinery A and Refinery
B where the total amount of lead being used is the same. But instead of each of them
using the same amount of lead, Refinery A uses a little less and Refinery B uses a little
more. Automatically that’s going to happen. A refiner who has higher than operating
costs for taking lead out will pay the tax and use a little bit more lead because the tax is
lower to him than the extra operating costs. A refiner’s who got lower than average
operating costs can save money by paying less tax if he goes down below the standard.
And so he’ll do that, and they’ll do it in a continuous way. Each one will have a slightly
different level where their cost is exactly equal to the tax.”
FRANK STASIO: The Environmental Protection Agency, however, doesn’t have the
authority to impose taxes so it regulates pollution by making rules. However, pollutant
tax arrangement are common between local governments and firms that dump wastewater
into public waterways. In those cases the tax is called an effluent fee. Another way to
provide incentives for pollution control is to offer tax credits to install control systems.
Of course taxing pollution is only possible when we can agree that a little bit of pollution
is all right. And in most cases we do accept some pollution because as Schwartz
explained earlier, the cost of controlling pollution makes it impractical to reduce the
output of most pollutants to zero. Schwartz says that trying to find an acceptable level of
pollution is a devilish process.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “Most pollutants are harmful at some level. And while we
sometimes pretend that there are thresholds below which no harm exists, that’s certainly
not true. Because (A) for many pollutants there are no thresholds. And even when there
is a threshold level in a person, um, before some health harm occurs, generally that level
is different for every person because different people are more or less susceptible. So if
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 10 -->

you take a broad distribution of two hundred and forty million people each with a
different threshold and you look at you know the number of incidences of illness or harm
or however you want to define it as a function of pollution level, there is on a population
basis another threshold because there are always some people whose threshold is lower
than the level you set.”
FRANK STASIO: So, we compromise. Instead of eliminating pollution entirely,
regulators try to reduce it to the point where the cost to society of any additional
reductions in pollution are greater than the benefits. This point is called the optimal
quantity of pollution. To arrive at this point, regulators take into account the fact that the
marginal cost of controlling pollution increase as standards rise. And as former EPA
Director William Ruckelshaus pointed out to a Senate Committee spending ever higher
amounts on controlling pollution doesn’t always bring greater benefits.
WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: “I…I sighted a specific example, uh, in my testimony
here two years ago, uh, from a plant that Weyerhaeuser had in the southern part of the
state of Washington where we went from, uh, zero to about ninety percent removal of
particulate matter, uh, in a…in a, uh, air quality region in the southeastern part of the
state or southwestern part of the state. Uh, and then under a technological requirement
called RACT, reasonably available control technology, on the statue, uh, we were forced,
that was a four million dollar expenditure, we were forced in this particular facility to go,
uh, to spend another six million dollars, fifty percent more than we spent the first time, to
remove six percent more pollution, uh, more particulate matter. On all the monitoring
stations that were around the plant, uh, there was not appreciable benefit…”
### MALE: “No significant change.”

WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS: “…no benefit associated with that expenditure. Now that
is the question which I think the…the Committee ought to address.”
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “For any given pollution control technology, it’s generally the case
that as you control tighter and tighter and tighter the marginal cost of that control goes
up. Um, and you have to use more and more equipment and fancier and fancier, um,

techniques. And so it generally does get more and more extensive. And at the same
time, even if there aren’t thresholds in the general population, presumably as you go to
lower and lower levels, the number of people who are sensitive at that level frequently,
but not always, declines. And you may have lower and lower benefits that you’re getting
at lower and lower standards in term—never mind dollars just in terms of health, um, at
the same time that you’re having higher and higher costs. And that’s one reason why
most people believe that it probably is someplace, you know, before you get to zero for
most pollutants where tho—those lines have to cross.”
FRANK STASIO: Of course there are political considerations which can distort a pure
cost benefit analysis.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “We…we have regulations on how you burn coal. And those
regulations basically require not that you meet a certain standard in how much sulfur
comes out of the stack when you burn the coal, but that you use a particular technology to
remove sulfur from the stack. And the reason is that the cheapest way to get very low
sulfur emissions is to use very low sulfur coal and not put any technology on. And by
requiring people to put on the technology whether they need it or not, we keep them from
switching to low sulfur coal and that makes the high sulfur coal miners very happy. Now
it’s true that if we didn’t do that, high sulfur coal miners would lose jobs. But it’s also
true that low sulfur coal miners would gain jobs. It’s probably the case that there would
be no net change in employment. But it’s pretty hard to take a job away from someone
who already has it in order to give it to somebody who doesn’t have it yet. And therefore
politically that has been unacceptable and therefore we stand an awful lot more money on
controlling sulfur dioxide than would otherwise be the case.”
FRANK STASIO: The Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 under
President Richard Nixon. While there has been no comprehensive cost benefit study to
show the overall economic effect of air and water pollution control since then, the impact
of government regulation on the environment is clear.
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “Even in just absolute levels from 1970 to now, there have been
reductions in the particulate levels in the air, reductions in sulfur dioxide, reductions in
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 12 -->

ozone levels. There have been reductions in the amount of gunk in rivers, um, even
reductions in…in some of the toxic chemicals that are in rivers. But those reductions
underestimate the benefits that have really occurred because the gross national product
has doubled since then. And we have much more industrial activity than we used to. So
what you really want to measure is not 1970 versus 1985 but 1985 versus 1985 if we
hadn’t had any of those controls. And in that case for air pollution you’re probably
talking about half the level of pollution that we would have otherwise had, um, from
many of the major pollutants. And for water pollution also, um, substantially lower
levels of…of those ones that we’ve focused on. And…and so there…there’s been a
substantial cleaning up of the environment.”
FRANK STASIO: But on the cost side is it possible that the gross national product may
have tripled if it wasn’t for the…the, uh, cost of, uh, cleaning up the environment?
JOEL SCHWARTZ: “No. That’s…that’s very unlikely. Uh, first of all you have to
remember that you know producing pollution control equipment is also an industry and
people work in that. And so we may have you know diverted some of the gross national
product from making widgets to making scrubbers, um, but if we have done that in an
intelligent way, namely we have required the right number of scrubbers, then that’s
production also, and that has value. Also another way to look at it is if you look at capital
investment by industry, in the Early Seventies when pollution control regulations first
came in, it is true that a lot of capital was being spent on pollution control by industry. I
mean it was still a very small percent of their total capital investment but it may have
been upwards of five percent of their capital investment was going into pollution control.
But that’s because we had essentially no regulations and they came in all of a sudden
everyone had to hurry up and do something. When you look at the late ‘70s and ‘80s
where we’re in a more of a steady state environment, I mean new regulations keep
coming out but we don’t have this tremendous hurry up, the percent of capital investment
that goes into pollution control equipment has fallen substantially and it’s really down to
a very trivial level. So even if there was dollar for dollar replacement of investment in
productive, um, equipment for pollution control equipment, um, it’s a pretty trivial effect.
And in fact there isn’t dollar for dollar replacement. If you spend an extra dollar on
© 2012 Educational Film Center & Annenberg Foundation

<!-- Page 13 -->

pollution control, you may reduce the amount you stand on productive investment but
you probably don’t reduce it by a full dollar. You probably reduce it by less than that.
Um, and so it’s very unlikely that there’s been a noticeable change in the gross national
product as a result of this.”
FRANK STASIO: Let’s review the important elements in our study of the economics of
environmental control. Not all costs are borne by the producers of a good. By-products
of production which are costly to society but not the firm are called externalities of
production. Social costs include all costs of production, external as well as internal costs.
The marginal cost of reducing pollution goes up as standards become more strict. In
trying to decide on the degree to which pollution should be regulated, policymakers
should weigh the value of the benefits of reducing each additional amount of pollution
against the cost. But there are many problems in evaluating the cost and benefits of
pollution. The difficulties in conducting environmental cost benefit analysis include
predicting accurately the number of people who may become ill at a given level of
pollution and second, placing a dollar value on illness or death. Environmental
regulation seeks to change pollution control from an externality to an internal cost to
make pollution control a more efficient process. There are two ways to control pollution.
The government can impose industry wide regulation which means that every firm must
meet the same standards or it can impose fees or taxes based on the amount of pollutant
the producer releases into the environment. Most experts consider the latter more
efficient since it allows individual firms to decide whether it would be cheaper to pay the
fine and not meet the standard or whether it would be more economical to meet or exceed
the standard. The tax would be levied at a rate that would ensure the environmental
standards would be met on average nationally. While industry and government continue
to debate the most efficient way to control pollution and protect public health and safety,
there is almost no argument about the merits of some form of environmental regulation.
